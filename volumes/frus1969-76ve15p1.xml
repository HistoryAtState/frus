                        United States</hi> , 1969–1976, Volume E–15, Documents on Eastern Europe,
                    1973–1976, as an electronic-only publication. This volume is the latest
                    publication in the subseries of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    series that documents the most important decisions and actions of the foreign
                    policy of the administrations of Presidents <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Richard
                        Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Gerald Ford</persName>.
                    Volume E–15 is the tenth <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume to be
                    published in this new format, available to all free of charge on the Internet.
                    Approximately 25 percent of the volumes scheduled for publication for the
                    1969–1976 subseries, covering the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    and <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_FGR1"
                        >Ford</persName> administrations, will be in this format.</p>
                <p>The documentation in this volume highlights U.S. policy toward Eastern Europe
                    from 1973–1976 during the period of détente. Relations with the
                    communist-dominated states of Eastern Europe warmed during this period, building
                    on the progress made during <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s first
                    term, the afterglow of détente with the Soviet Union, and U.S. withdrawal from
                    Vietnam. The documents opening this volume show that U.S. foreign policy still
                    perceived the countries of Eastern Europe as sharing the status of “captive
                    nations” under Soviet domination, but held hopes for improved bilateral
                    relations on a country-by-country basis. The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> and Ford Administrations' ambitions for improved relations
                    with Hungary and Czechoslovakia remained unrealized, and U.S. contacts with
                    Bulgaria and Albania were extremely limited. The majority of this volume focuses
                    on those countries with which the United States had major continuing bilateral
                    relations, evident in new or improved economic, cultural, and political-military
                    relations: Romania, Yugoslavia, and Poland. These three countries, both
                    Administrations hoped, were most likely to assert their independence from
                    Moscow. Finally, although the United States officially established diplomatic
                    ties with the German Democratic Republic during this period, relations remained
                    limited and evidenced a continuing low level of tension over the status of
                    divided Berlin.</p>
                <p>In its first term, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    Administration had focused on increasing contacts with Yugoslavia and Romania;
                    in its second term—as well as after President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1"
                        >Ford</persName> took office—Poland emerged as a country of primary U.S.
                    interest. Polish First Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Edward
                        Gierek</persName> visited Washington during October 1974, and President
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> visited Poland in the summer of
                    1975. In 1976, <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>'s government fell
                    into disarray when it drastically raised the prices of basic commodities,
                    especially food, in response to an economic downturn. The resulting workers
                    riots forced <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> to abandon this policy
                    and threatened to destabilize his government. Despite continued improvements in
                    U.S.-Polish relations during this period, U.S. intelligence and diplomatic
                    sources alike had begun to question the ultimate stability of the Gierek
                    regime.</p>
                <p>Yugoslavia and Romania continued to hold the most promising prospects for
                    improved U.S. relations with Eastern European nations. Romania seemed the most
                    stable country by the end of 1976 and, as such, received the greatest share of
                    official attention from the United States. There was also a flurry of high-level
                    contact between the two countries, which underscored a growing cordial
                    relationship. In December 1973, President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Nicolae
                        Ceausescu</persName> became the first Eastern European head of state to make
                    an official visit to the United States. Another visit from Ceausescu followed in
                    June 1975. In return, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> briefly
                    stopped in Bucharest in November 1974, and <persName corresp="#p_FGR1"
                        >Ford</persName> paid an official state visit to Bucharest and Sinaia 9
                    months later. Romania became the first Eastern Bloc nation to win most-favored
                    nation trade status from the United States. While recognizing the harshness of
                    Ceausecu's internal policy, the United States sought to encourage him to act
                    independently of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Yugoslavia was easily the most independent of Moscow's orbit—and therefore a
                    natural focus of U.S. attention in Eastern Europe for a quarter century—but
                    faced a looming succession crisis. The health and visibility of Yugoslav
                    President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Josip Broz Tito</persName> became an
                    increasing source of speculation among diplomatic and intelligence sources. All
                    evaluations of relations with Belgrade during this period, first and foremost,
                    demanded a focus on identifying <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s
                    probable successor and orienting the country's military to a congenial view of
                    the United States. In 1976, the United States prepared a lengthy contingency
                    study for a hypothetical post-Tito Soviet invasion of Yugoslavia. The
                    Departments of State and Defense negotiated the sales of military equipment to
                    Yugoslavia, which might enable it to resist such an invasion. In 1976, the
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administration concluded a
                    significant agreement to sell <gloss target="#t_TOW1">TOW</gloss> anti-tank
                    missile systems to Yugoslavia. The question of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                        >Tito</persName>'s successor, of course, remained unclear—and unanswered—by
                    the time <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> departed office.</p>
                <p>U.S. relations with the German Democratic Republic served as a counterpoint to
                    the overall trend toward a thaw in U.S.-Eastern European relations. Despite the
                    signing of the Quadripartite Agreement in September 1971, the status of West
                    Berlin remained contentious, especially over U.S. concerns about Soviet
                    interference with, and delays for, supplies, personnel, and civilians transiting
                    in and out of West Berlin. The U.S. initiative to open relations with the German
                    Democratic Republic originated from Secretary of State <persName
                        corresp="#p_RWP1">William Rogers</persName>; <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName>, in particular, was unenthusiastic about establishing
                    formal diplomatic ties, and would have further delayed taking action were it not
                    for the pressures generated by West German Chancellor <persName
                        corresp="#p_BWHF1">Willy Brandt</persName>'s Ostpolitik and recognition by
                    Great Britain and France. As a result, the recognition of the German Democratic
                    Republic and the establishment of an embassy in East Berlin in 1974 did not
                    immediately lead to a more cordial bilateral relationship.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor, plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the
                    series. Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official
                    regulations codifying specific standards for the selection and editing of
                    documents for the series on March 26, 1925. Those regulations, with minor
                    modifications, guided the series through 1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992
                    and 1993, which was signed by President <persName corresp="#p_BGHW1">George H.W.
                        Bush</persName> on October 28, 1991, established a new statutory charter for
                    the preparation of the series. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138 added a new Title IV
                    to the Department of State's Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4351, et
                    seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series must include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation of
                    major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government. The
                    statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg in
                    1928: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by
                    historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or deletions
                    made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been made; the
                    published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in reaching
                    a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purpose of concealing a defect
                    in policy. The 1991 statute also requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30 years after the events
                    recorded.</p>

                    administrations, will be in this format. The decision to institute this change
                    was taken in full consultation with the Department's Advisory Committee on
                    Historical Diplomatic Documentation, which was established under the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> statute. The advantages of this new
                    method of presenting documentation are evident in this volume: the format
                    enables convenient access to a large amount of key documentation on a broader
                    range of issues, all or any portion of which can be easily downloaded.
                    Annotation—the value added element of documentary editing—is still present in
                    limited form, but not to the scale of a <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>
                    print volume. This electronic-only publication results in substantial savings in
                    cost and time of production, thus allowing the series to present a fuller range
                    of documentation on a wider range of topics sooner than would have been possible
                    under a print-only format. These advantages compensate for the fact that this
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volume is not an actual book bound
                    in traditional ruby buckram. The Department of State, the Historian, the General
                    Editor, and the Historical Advisory Committee are all dedicated to publishing
                    the great majority of the volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series in print form; these are also posted in electronic
                    format on the Department of State's website. While the future of research in
                    documentary publications is increasingly tied to the ease of use and
                    availability of the Internet, the Department of State will continue to use both
                    print and electronic-only versions to make the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series available to the widest audience possible. In that
                    sense, this innovation is in keeping with the general principles of the series,
                    which was begun by President Lincoln and Secretary of State Seward and continued
                    by subsequent presidents and secretaries of state for 140 years.</p>

                <p>The documentation in this volume highlights U.S. policy toward Eastern Europe
                    from 1973–1976 in the period of détente. Relations with the communist-dominated
                    states of Eastern Europe warmed during this period, building on the progress
                    made during <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s first term, the
                    afterglow of détente with the Soviet Union, and U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam.
                    The documents opening this volume affirm that U.S. foreign policy still
                    perceived Eastern Europe's collective status as “captive nations” under Soviet
                    domination but held hopes for improved bilateral relations on a
                    country-by-country basis. The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administrations' ambitions for
                    improved relations with Hungary and Czechoslovakia remained unrealized, and U.S.
                    contacts with Bulgaria and Albania were extremely limited. Documentation on
                    these countries is contained only in the Eastern Europe Regional chapter. The
                    majority of this volume focuses on those countries with which the United States
                    had major continuing bilateral relations, evident in new or improved economic,
                    cultural, and political-military relations: Romania, Yugoslavia, and Poland.
                    These three countries, the Administration hoped, were most likely to assert
                    their independence from Moscow. Finally, although the United States officially
                    established diplomatic ties to the German Democratic Republic during this
                    period, relations remained limited and evidenced a continuing low level of
                    tension over the status of divided Berlin.</p>
                <p>The primary hope for better relations was the prospect of increased interaction.
                    Both <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> believed that normalization of
                    economic relations could gradually bring about greater social and political
                    liberty in Eastern Europe without raising suspicions among leadership of the
                    Soviet Union that the United States was trying to undermine the Soviet bloc. In
                    October 1972, President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> convened a
                    review of economic relations with Eastern Europe resulting in a recommendation
                    of incremental normalization of economic relations with all communist states of
                    Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>Greater trade relations with Eastern Europe required a reevaluation of existing
                    measures restricting trade with communist nations, primarily those governing the
                    release of sensitive or advanced technology. The Coordinating Committee on
                    Export Controls, the primary multilateral organ to regulate the sale of
                    strategically sensitive products and technology to communist nations, adjusted
                    the classification of certain types of technology, notably those governing the
                    processing rates of computers, to facilitate their export to communist nations.
                    The <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration also extended
                    rights of navigation to Eastern Bloc nations in U.S. ports (with the notable
                    exception of the Port of Charleston, which was excluded for national security
                    reasons). Despite the new openness in economic relations, U.S. efforts to
                    address Eastern Europeans beyond state-to-state diplomacy continued: the
                    President's Commission on International Radio Broadcasting, headed by <persName
                        corresp="#p_EMS1">Milton Eisenhower</persName>, urged <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> at the outset of his second term to
                    redefine and renew the mission of Radio Free Europe, which remained under
                    government control.</p>
                <p>The results for improving bilateral relations with key nations in Eastern Europe
                    remained mixed. In its first term, the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> administration had focused on increasing contacts with
                    Yugoslavia and Romania; in the second term, Poland emerged as a third country of
                    primary U.S. interest. Polish First Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Edward
                        Gierek</persName> visited Washington during October 1974 and President
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> visited Poland with the usual
                    signatures of statements of better political and economic relations in the
                    summer of 1975. In the summer of 1976 Gierek's government fell into disarray,
                    when it drastically raised the prices of basic commodities, especially food, in
                    response to an economic downturn. The resulting workers' riots, primarily in
                    Radom and Warsaw, forced <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> to abandon
                    this policy and threatened to destabilize his government. Despite continued
                    improvements in U.S.-Polish relations during this period, U.S. intelligence and
                    diplomatic sources alike had begun to question the ultimate stability of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> regime.</p>
                <p>Yugoslavia and Romania remained the most promising prospects for improved U.S.
                    relations with Eastern European nations. Romania seemed the most stable country
                    by the end of 1976 and, as such, received the greatest share of official
                    attention from the United States. President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Nicolae
                        Ceausescu</persName>'s willingness to break with Moscow over the Prague
                    Spring in 1968 and his support for U.S. foreign policy made him an attractive
                    target for <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. The second term was a flurry of
                    high-level contact between the two countries that underscored a growing cordial
                    relationship. Ceausescu became the first Eastern European head of state to make
                    an official visit to the United States in December 1973. Another visit from
                    Ceausescu followed in June 1975. In return, <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                        >Kissinger</persName> briefly stopped in Bucharest in 1974, and <persName
                        corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> paid an official state visit to Bucharest
                    and Sinaia nine months later. Romania successfully negotiated the sales of
                    commercial aircraft in 1973 and, through the Trade Act of 1974, became the first
                    Eastern Bloc nation to win Most-Favored Nation trade status from the United
                    States. Bucharest also pushed Washington for access to purchase military
                    equipment, but the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> administration
                    remained cool to the idea.</p>
                <p>Yugoslavia was easily the most independent of Moscow's orbit—and therefore a
                    natural focus of U.S. attention in Eastern Europe for a quarter century—but
                    faced a looming succession crisis. The health and visibility of Yugoslav
                    President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Josip Broz Tito</persName> became an
                    increasing source of speculation among diplomatic and intelligence sources. All
                    evaluations of relations with Belgrade during this period, first and foremost,
                    demanded a focus on identifying Tito's probable successor and orienting the
                    country's military to a congenial view of the United States. In 1976, the United
                    States prepared a lengthy contingency study for a hypothetical post-Tito Soviet
                    invasion of Yugoslavia. The Departments of State and Defense negotiated the
                    sales of military equipment to Yugoslavia, which might enable it to resist such
                    an invasion. In 1976, the Ford administration concluded a significant agreement
                    to sell <gloss target="#t_TOW1">TOW</gloss> anti-tank missile systems to
                    Yugoslavia. The question of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s
                    successor, of course, remained unclear—and unanswered—by the time <persName
                        corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> departed office.</p>
                <p>U.S. relations with the German Democratic Republic, serves as a counterpoint to
                    the overall thawing trend in U.S.-Eastern European relations. Despite the
                    signing of the Quadripartite Agreement in September 1971, the status of West
                    Berlin remained contentious, especially over U.S. concerns about Soviet
                    interference and delays to supplies, personnel, and civilians transiting in and
                    out of West Berlin. Bonn's intention to place a Federal Environmental Office in
                    West Berlin exacerbated East-West tensions. The U.S. initiative to open
                    relations with the German Democratic Republic originated from Secretary of State
                        <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName>; <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName>, in particular, was unenthusiastic about establishing
                    formal diplomatic ties and would have further delayed taking action were it not
                    for the pressures generated by West German Chancellor <persName
                        corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>'s Ostpolitik and recognition by Great
                    Britain and France. As a result, the recognition of the German Democratic
                    Republic and the establishment of an Embassy in East Berlin in 1974 did not
                    immediately lead to a more cordial bilateral relationship.</p>
                <p>Although Eastern Europe certainly was not foremost among national security or
                    diplomatic concerns during the second <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> term, the
                    issue of Eastern Europe had unforeseen domestic political consequences for the
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administration as a result of
                    the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe of 1975. Critics of the
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administration perceived the
                    Helsinki Conference, which recognized the territorial integrity of the states of
                    Europe, as one that granted legitimacy to the Soviet Union's territorial gains
                    after World War II and legitimized Soviet control of Eastern Europe. When
                    informal remarks by Department of State Counselor <persName corresp="#p_SHH1"
                        >Helmut Sonnenfeldt</persName> to European Chiefs of Mission's London
                    Conference in December 1975 about an “organic relationship” between the Soviet
                    Union and Eastern Europe were released in the press, <persName corresp="#p_FGR1"
                        >Ford</persName>'s critics—especially those on his political Right—charged
                    that the <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administration had
                    “abandoned” Eastern Europe to the Soviet sphere of influence. The “<persName
                        corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName> Doctrine,” which the Administration
                    strenuously disavowed, nonetheless created problems of public perception for
                    Ford, whose Republican Party was attempting to woo ethnic blue-collar workers (a
                    traditional Democratic constituency) in the 1976 election. To make matters
                    worse, <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> claimed during a Presidential
                    candidates' debate with Governor Jimmy Carter that there was “no Soviet
                    domination” of Eastern Europe. This gaffe elevated the public perception of
                        <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>'s lack of knowledge of foreign
                    affairs and the Soviet Union's relationship with Eastern Europe.</p>

                    historical materials. The PRMPA and implementing public access regulations
                    require NARA to review for additional restrictions in order to ensure the
                    protection of the privacy rights of former <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> White House officials, since these officials were not
                    given the opportunity to separate their personal materials from public papers.
                    Thus, the PRMPA and related implementing public access regulations require NARA
                    to notify formally the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Estate and
                    former <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> White House staff members
                    that the agency is scheduling for public release <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> White House historical materials. The <persName
                        corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> Estate and former White House staff
                    members have 30 days to contest the release of <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                        >Nixon</persName> historical materials in which staff members were
                    participants or are mentioned. Further, the PRMPA and implementing regulations
                    require NARA to segregate and return to the creator of files private and
                    personal materials. All <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes that

                </p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    Department of State, conducted the declassification review of all the documents
                    published in this volume. The review was undertaken in accordance with the
                    standards set forth in Executive Order 12958, as amended, on Classified National
                    Security Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign
                    governments. The final declassification review of this volume, which began in
                    2007 and was completed in 2008, resulted in the decision to withhold 0 documents
                    in full, to excise a paragraph or more in 3 documents, and to make minor
                    excisions in 5 documents. The editors are confident, on the basis of the
                    research conducted in preparing this volume and as a result of the
                    declassification review process described, that this volume is an accurate
                    record of the foreign policy of the <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                    and <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> administrations toward Eastern
                    Europe for the 1973 to 1976 period.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>On March 29, 1972, you directed that the Under Secretaries Committee,
                            following the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> List Review,
                            undertake a basic examination of how the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> system should be used in the future to control
                            exports to Communist countries.</p>
                        <p>The Committee's report is attached. All agencies agree that the system
                            has been effective and has made a valuable contribution to the success
                            of our deterrent strategy. All agree also that there have been problems
                            in maintaining the cooperation of the other <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> members and that these problems threaten the
                            continued effectiveness of the system. Generally speaking, the U.S. has
                            been in favor of maintaining more extensive controls than our <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> partners who are constantly seeking
                            reductions in the embargo coverage. Our difficulties in <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> are presently exacerbated by the
                            prevailing spirit of detente, the new emphasis on East-West trade, and
                            increased commercial pressures which have accompanied these developments
                            in the U.S. as well as abroad. Defense believes many of our difficulties
                            in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> are also traceable to
                            deep-seated differences in viewpoint toward <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> among the principal U.S. departments and agencies
                            involved in the Washington decision-making machinery.</p>
                        <p>The agencies have agreed that we should reject the more extreme options
                            of abolishing <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> and <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d1-02" facs="d1-02"/>relying on U.S. unilateral controls and
                            bilateral understandings (Option D), or reconstituting <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> as an East-West trade coordinating
                            body (Option E). The agencies have also agreed on a number of procedural
                            steps to help the system function more smoothly (Option B, parts 1-3).
                            The agencies differ, however, on the more basic course of action which
                            the U.S. should adopt in dealing with the difficulties described
                            above.</p>
                        <p>There are two such basic approaches reflected in the study: <list>
                                <item>--- the first, proposed by Defense (Option A) and supported by
                                    AEC specifically as regards Sub-Options A (4) - (6), seeks to
                                    prevent deterioration of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                                    by a positive U.S. program whose chief thrust would be to secure
                                    greater recognition at home and abroad of the important and
                                    direct linkage between national security and U.S. defense
                                    expenditures on the one hand and strategic trade controls on the
                                    other;</item>
                                <item>--- the second, proposed by State and Commerce, envisages a
                                    thorough analysis of the embargo list well in advance of the
                                    next <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> List Review in
                                    order to satisfy both ourselves and our <gloss
                                        target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> partners that we have made
                                    every effort to limit the embargo coverage to the minimum
                                    necessary based on sound strategic evaluations -- a program as
                                    set forth in Sub-Option C (4) that would utilize the
                                    government-industry technical advisory groups provided for in
                                    the Export Administration Act as recently amended and would
                                    assure that U.S. objectives in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                        >COCOM</gloss> are fully consistent with our changing
                                    political and economic relationships with the Communist
                                    countries.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The comments of the members of the Committee have applicability to these
                            two approaches. Defense and AEC, as qualified, would not reject a
                            careful review <pb n="3" xml:id="d1-03" facs="d1-03"/>of the embargo
                            list provided it is undertaken in connection with the program outlined
                            in Option A and does not presuppose a further sharp reduction. Defense
                            believes, however, that the thrust of the review would be to reduce the
                            controls considerably below their present levels in order to reduce the
                                <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> workload and help to
                            eliminate present frictions with other <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> members. Defense believes this approach should be
                            rejected first on security grounds, because a sharp reduction has just
                            been made, and second, on practical grounds because our <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> partners are not appeased by such
                            U.S. action.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, while neither State nor Commerce supports
                            Defense-proposed Option A as set forth, Commerce believes that the
                            approaches to other governments foreseen in Sub-Options A (1) and (4)
                            could, indeed, be useful if tied to implementation of Sub-Option C (4)
                            but believes strongly that the advantages from pursuing these approaches
                            would be maximized if they were not made now but at the outset of the
                            next <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> List Review, which will
                            probably occur in late 1974 or early 1975. State considers that such
                            approaches at an appropriate time and level might well be useful, but
                            believes it is too soon now to determine the timing and form of such
                            tactics. Unlike <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, State also believes
                            that we cannot properly influence the degree to which defense elements
                            in member governments have a role in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> matters (Sub-Option A (2)) and that it would be
                            impractical to try to relate <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                            formally to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> (Sub-Option A (3)).
                            The Atomic Energy Commission favors a positive program to prevent
                            deterioration of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> as reflected in
                            Option A and specifically recommends Sub-Options (4), (5), and (6). The
                            Commission has also expressed the view that a review of the <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> List should be undertaken within
                            the kind of current policy guidance or criteria suggested in Sub-Option
                            A (5) without preconception of how the list should be limited.</p>
                        <p>The choice between these two approaches involves a decision on the
                            priority to be given the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> effort
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d1-04" facs="d1-04"/>in relations to other
                            elements in our national policies. The first approach involves a
                            concerted and strenuous U.S. initiative to strengthen support for the
                            system. It is based on a relatively high appreciation of <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>'s past achievements and a
                            pessimistic view of its future effectiveness without this major effort.
                            The other approach would attempt to assure that U.S. efforts in <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> are in perspective with current
                            developments in East-West relations; it is based on a pessimistic view
                            of the prospects for influencing our allies toward a stronger course of
                            action in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>In Defense's view, nothing in the Committee's report shows our <gloss
                                target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> effort to be in conflict with other
                            elements of our national policies. On the contrary, as pointed out
                            above, the system makes a valuable contribution to the success of our
                            deterrent strategy and thus augments a major element of our policies --
                            national defense. Moreover, it is precisely “to assure that U.S. efforts
                            in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> are in perspective with
                            current developments in East-West relations” that steps must be taken to
                            prevent deterioration of the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                            system. In a period when trade prospects appear brighter, it is tempting
                            but dangerous to overlook the fact that the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> system is concerned with security and should be
                            altered in response to developments in East-West military, rather than
                            economic, relations. Defense, therefore, believes that the choice
                            between the two approaches outlined in the study involves decision on
                            the importance of export controls in our deterrent strategy; on their
                            effectiveness in retarding communist military progress, their
                            consequences for our defense budget, their impact on our trade and on
                            our overall relations with our allies; in short, on the diplomatic and
                            commercial costs of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> relative to
                            its military and economic value to the United States.</p>

                                particular. Since World War II it has been a primary Soviet interest
                                to retain close control of this zone, particularly that part of it
                                lying between the German-speaking Western states (<gloss

                            <p>In 1968 in Czechoslovakia, the Soviets reiterated the lesson of
                                Budapest 1956 - when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> sees
                                its security threatened by developments in Eastern Europe, it is
                                prepared to use military power to restore what it regards as an
                                adequate degree of control. The Soviets, however, continue to
                                struggle with the problem of defining their relations with Eastern
                                European countries. The pressures within the area, the highly
                                negative consequences of the invasion of Czechoslovakia in the
                                international Communist movement, and the acceleration of Moscow's
                                efforts toward detente in Europe has led the Soviets reluctantly to
                                accept the markedly independent foreign policy of Romania (as well
                                as that of Yugoslavia). They have also acquiesced in Hungary's
                                considerable departure from the Soviet economic model and adopted
                                hands-off policy when Poland faced a serious workers' strike in
                                1970. This <pb n="8" xml:id="d2-08" facs="d2-08"/>range of tolerance

                                of reduced markets in Western Europe as a result of the expansion of
                                the European Economic Community, pressure from consumers, and a
                                commitment to maintain high economic growth rates. The countries of
                                Eastern Europe are distinct from the Soviet Union in that trade is
                                more important to them, consumer expectations are higher, they have
                                stronger traditional links with Western Europe, and they are
                                concerned about the maintenance of their assured market in the
                                Soviet Union for products which are difficult to market in the West
                                or in developing countries. As illustrated by the forward movement
                                in economic relations with Poland in 1972 and the productive
                                November 1972 meeting at the Joint Polish-American Commercial
                                Commission, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has an interest in
                                improved relations with Eastern Europe similar to that which it has
                                in the case of the Soviet Union. The main difference is that the
                                broad, world-wide interests of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                                are not affected in the same degree in the case of Eastern Europe
                                and the possibility of securing new sources of energy which exists
                                in the case of the Soviet Union does not exist in the case of

                                that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic policies are now
                                more liberal toward the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> than
                                they are toward Eastern Europe. The countries of Eastern Europe are
                                conscious of this fact and are currently attempting to achieve the
                                same status now accorded to the Soviet Union. Since the Soviet Union
                                has led the way, it is now easier for the countries of Eastern
                                Europe to take a more forthcoming stance toward improved economic
                                relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>It is likely that the Soviets, having signed their commercial
                                agreement with us in 1972, expect that these <pb n="9"
                                    xml:id="d2-09" facs="d2-09"/>Eastern European moves toward
                                normalization of economic relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> will progress. It may be assumed that the Soviet
                                Union has even stimulated or approved these overtures given the fact
                                that the three most closely controlled Eastern European regimes,
                                Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                    >GDR</gloss>, have all explicitly bid during the last quarter of
                                1972 for such normalization. By the same token it may be assumed
                                that the Soviets, as illustrated by their negative reaction to the
                                “human contacts” or “freedom of movement” element in the <gloss

                                to revive ideological defenses in Eastern Europe, will monitor
                                closely the degree to which economic normalization is accompanied by
                                cultural or even political normalization or a pace of internal
                                reform which might threaten their very authoritarian view of the
                                leading role of the Communist party in each country.</p>

                                Background</p>
                            <p>Although <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests in the area
                                covered by this study have remained constant since World War II in
                                view of the potential Soviet threat to Western Europe, the degree of
                                emphasis on them has altered over time. In a period of essentially
                                military confrontation dating from the Berlin blockade until
                                Stalin's death, denial of economic or technological potential to the
                                Soviet military was dominant. In the period of essentially political
                                confrontation and maneuver since that time, encouragement to other
                                Eastern European states to follow the example of Yugoslavia's
                                independent posture has been a dominant interest, as illustrated
                                most recently in the development of useful high-level contacts
                                between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Romania. In the
                                period ahead, while political confrontation and maneuver will
                                continue, there is an opportunity to increase <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> influence throughout the area to some degree and to
                                gain some modest trade and financial benefits by responding to what
                                are apparently Soviet-authorized bids from the countries of the area
                                for negotiation of normal economic relations. The normalization
                                process can provide an opportunity to clear up long-standing claims
                                and financial problems.</p>

                            <p>The process can also facilitate negotiation where needed of an
                                appropriate framework for consular and cultural relations which we

                                be subject to resolution if, in the course of economic
                                normalization, use is made of the increased economic leverage
                                stemming from the interest in normalization of economic relations
                                with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> recently expressed by all

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The main issue is
                            whether, in our relations with the countries of Eastern Europe, we are
                            driven primarily by economic consideration, pursue both political and
                            economic issues simultaneously, or establish some sort of priorities
                            with some sort of game plan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: Yugoslavia and
                            Poland are well on the track. Hungary has signed a claims agreement but
                            commercial talks can be held off.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Be sure Romania
                            stays ahead of Hungary. Romania stuck its neck out for us, and there's
                            no sense in rewarding Hungary who played it safe in 1969 when they
                            wouldn't even let our astronauts visit there. If Romania stays ahead,
                            this is, in a way, an answer to the other issues.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: With regard to
                            Romania, we thought we could wait for the trade legislation and get a
                            feel for the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> issue. Then we could go
                            into commercial talks with the Romanians.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The trade bill
                            gives blanket <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> authority to the
                            President, doesn't it?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: The bond issue is
                            still outstanding with the Romanians. They have indicated that they're
                            ready to negotiate but the talks haven't started yet.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName>: With Romania, we also
                            have to worry about the fallout of the Jewish emigration issue.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Since when has it
                            been our national policy to get into emigration policies of other
                            countries?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_JHM1">Jackson</persName>'s amendment covers all the
                            non-market countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Do any Eastern
                            European countries permit free emigration?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But the restriction
                            would apply to all?</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d3-03" facs="d3-03"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: Yes. The tax
                            situation in these countries in not bad, though.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ELS1">Eagleburger</persName>: Yugoslavia's
                            pretty good, aren't they?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName>: It's bad in
                            Romania.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: <persName
                                corresp="#p_JHM1">Jackson</persName> is aiming at the Russians,
                            though.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName>: But as his amendment
                            is drafted now, it's much broader.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Does it hit all
                            Eastern European countries?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName>: It comes close. The
                            President would have to certify in each case. There will have to be
                            changes in the amendment as it has been drafted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We're determined to
                            make a major fight on this issue. How successful will we be?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: We'll talk to the
                            Jewish leaders.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName>: And to the
                            Israelis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We did talk to the
                            Israelis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: The rate of Jewish
                            emigrations from the Soviet Union is really quite good compared to the
                            past. On the economic negotiations, if we start with Romania, we could
                            go to Hungary next.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know the
                            President's view on this. He wants to combine economic and political
                            considerations and to move faster toward those countries who are
                            conducting a foreign policy we can live with. We should get a game plan
                            on the order of the countries and on what we might consider as political
                            and economic quid pro quos.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: With Czechoslovakia
                            and Bulgaria, we're talking about a consular convention and we want to
                            push them on that. We think we can finish with the Czechs soon. Then we
                            would plan to move on to cultural and scientific and technical
                            agreements with both of them. We have a complicated claims situation
                            with the Czechs which we should try to wrap up before we get into
                            commercial talks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But others want to
                            move faster?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJT1">Connor</persName>: We don't want to wait
                            for all these other things before we can do business with these
                            countries.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d3-04" facs="d3-04"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName>: I'm troubled by
                            bracketing cultural with scientific and technical agreements. I think
                            cultural agreements should be put ahead and we should ease off on any
                            exchanges of scientific and technical information.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Our tendency is to
                            look at their foreign policies before we move too fast in the economic
                            area. We can't always expect them to agree with us, but we expect them
                            not to harass us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: We're concerned
                            about the treatment of our Embassy personnel which isn't good in
                            Bulgaria.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FL2">Fox</persName>: We're concerned about the
                            balance of payments. The prospect of growth toward the East is four
                            times that to the West. We think we should relate our political
                            objectives to economic considerations--it is a nuance rather than a
                            priority.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We went through all
                            this four years ago with the Soviet Union. We were told that if we
                            encouraged trade it would improve the political climate. We went the
                            other way. As soon as there was political progress, we liberalized
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJT1">Connor</persName>: But now we have a big
                            trade deficit. We should promote trade because we need the business. It
                            has nothing to do with politics.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: But the trade is
                            already coming--look at Czechoslovakia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJT1">Connor</persName>: East Germany shows
                            differently.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: East Germany is at
                            the end of the list. Our policy toward East Germany will be governed by
                            our relations with our ally, West Germany, not by economic
                            considerations. The Communist countries will tie themselves to the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> for their own interests. We don't
                            have to buy them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FL2">Fox</persName>: All we're suggesting is
                            that we give these economic considerations a higher priority than
                            before. It can be done without denigrating other objectives.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: All we're asking is
                            that some interagency group gives us some game plan so that not everyone
                            is proceeding on his own theory. (to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1"
                                >Stoessel</persName>) Can State prepare a game plan--the order of
                            countries, how we should proceed with each, what we want from each. Then
                            we can issue some sensible instructions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FL2">Fox</persName>: We have no objection to
                            such a plan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And we don't want
                            all you people to run wild before you receive these instructions. We'll
                            do a brief paper for the President, laying out the plan and the criteria
                            for each country.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d3-05" facs="d3-05"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: We'll do Romania
                            first, then Hungary. Poland is taken care of. We can proceed on other
                            things with Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. Then, after that, we can move
                            to commercial talks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Be sure they
                            understand that we're watching their political performance.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: Some of them are
                            still criticizing the bombing of North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Also we're watching
                            the Hungarian performance on the International Commission. We expect
                            them to behave.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: Have they been
                            difficult?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No, except for one
                            serious case and they should be called on this one. There was one clear,
                            uncontestable violation which they refused to investigate because they
                            knew they couldn't investigate without finding the violation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ELS1">Eagleburger</persName>: The Poles
                            also.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We're going to ask
                            State to call them both in.</p>
                        <p>Gen. <persName corresp="#p_SB3">Scowcroft</persName>: I've already talked
                            to Ted Eliot about it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: And we want a
                            vigorous and convincing presentation. We want a report on the
                            conversation by Friday.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <persName>Casey</persName> arrived)</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName>: On the question of
                                <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480, Agriculture is interested in
                            changing the law and expanding the program. We don't think it would be
                            desirable to encourage this in the Congress at this time. We don't need
                            any more soft currencies in Eastern Europe now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: We don't have any
                            trouble with that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Hennessy</persName>: Treasury goes along with the idea of a
                            game plan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There are two
                            considerations: 1) We should link economic considerations with political
                            moves; the President wants to use economic considerations to get
                            political leverage and pace economic progress to political progress. 2)
                            How do we define political progress? Is a scientific agreement of
                            sufficient importance to gear the expansion of <pb n="6" xml:id="d3-06"
                                facs="d3-06"/>commercial ties to a scientific agreement? I can't say
                            that the President would feel that a scientific agreement should precede
                            economic ties, but he does care about how the country performs in the

                            Obviously we won't ask them not to vote with the Soviets but we will ask
                            them not to make inflammatory, anti-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            speeches. We can't break them off from the Soviets but we can get some
                            impartiality. As to the types of agreements, the line can be shifted
                            from country to country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: Claims, then, can
                            be gotten out of the way.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Our general policy
                            is that claims should be gotten out of the way first. Cultural
                            agreements are generally good, and scientific and technical agreements
                            should be looked at on a case by case basis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: We would like
                            cultural agreements, with the scientific and technical folded in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName>: This helps on
                            personnel exchanges.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If they know that
                            their political activity sets the limits. We did it with big
                            brother--they can't complain. If it's reasonable to try to get a
                            cultural agreement, fine. But they have to know it isn't free if they
                            continue to take the most extreme positions. We know we can't ask Poland
                            and Bulgaria to vote against the Soviets in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>--that would be a ridiculous criterion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: But they could
                            moderate their propaganda attacks.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Hennessey</persName>: We're talking about a pretty short
                            time period in which to measure progress. We won't see great shifts in a
                            short time.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But we have to give
                            them the idea that these things aren't free. Our economic negotiations
                            with the Soviets were geared to political factors and it benefited
                            everyone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FL2">Fox</persName>: But cultural and
                            scientific agreements don't belong in the same ball game.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I can see that we
                            need a directive that can't be misinterpreted. We'll write it if State
                            gives us a paper that we can give to the President that states some
                            criteria and some sequence of events. Then I'll talk to you (Casey). We
                            need a game plan--what we want from each country.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d3-07" facs="d3-07"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: We have most of
                            that already in the paper. We'll boil it down.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Casey</persName>: Have you discussed the idea of having a
                            Joint Economic Commission for each Eastern European country? We have one
                            with the Poles and the Soviets and now the Hungarians want one. We
                            question the value of it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We'll run out of
                            staff.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HDR1">Hinton</persName>: If we slow down on
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> and commercial agreements we
                            don't need a commission. They were useful at first, but it's a lousy
                            precedent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: We've tried to
                            steer the Hungarians toward a mixed Chamber of Commerce.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_FL2">Fox</persName>: Let's assess the results
                            of the first two commissions. They could be helpful, and we're
                            open-minded about them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJT1">Connor</persName>: It's the way they do
                            business with the rest of the world. You say the economic considerations
                            shouldn't be free but we're running a trade deficit here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: How many
                            dollars?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CJT1">Connor</persName>: East-West trade may
                            show $1 billion net by the end of the decade.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But we already have
                            agreements with Romania, Poland and Hungary. Poland has <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> and Romania has it in principle. So
                            you're talking about Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, East Germany and Albania.
                            With East Germany, the political factors are overwhelming. The President
                            is lagging far behind in our recognition policy. If East Germany deals
                            with us they will do it for reasons far beyond economic.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWG1">Hyland</persName>: In the creation of a
                            Joint Commission, Romania should precede Hungary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In all things.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HWG1">Hyland</persName>: Poland and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> have one but Romania doesn't.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>: The Romanians don't
                            want one.</p>

                        <p>Transmitted herewith in response to your request of March 7 to Under
                            Secretary Casey following the Senior Review Group meeting on <gloss
                                target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss> 163/<gloss target="#t_CIEPSM1"
                                >CIEPSM</gloss> 24, is a brief outline on a country-by-country basis
                            of actions we propose to take in the coming year with regard to the
                            eight countries covered by that study. The outline is based on the
                            assumption that movement toward economic normalization with these
                            countries is desirable for trade promotion reasons but that it also
                            affords us an opportunity to press for a better atmosphere of overall
                            relations as well as for the completion of unfinished bilateral business
                            in the financial, cultural, and consular areas.</p>
                        <p>The actions proposed in the outline are based on the understanding
                            reached at the meeting that the principal negotiating problems ahead of
                            us this year concern countries with which we have diplomatic relations
                            but with which we have not yet normalized economic relations to the
                            extent of extending most-favored-nation treatment (Romania, Hungary,
                            Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria). They are also based on the judgement that
                            we should not enter into negotiation of issues which would be included
                            in commercial agreements involving the extension of most-favored-nation
                            treatment until Congressional consideration of the trade bill is far
                            enough along so that it is evident that the bill will pass this session.
                            It therefore accepts as a working hypothesis the likelihood that <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="d4-02" facs="d4-02"/>we will not be able to start our
                            first negotiation of a commercial agreement until fall.</p>
                        <p>The outline also reflects the agreement reached at the meeting that
                            negotiation of commercial agreements should be done in sequence starting
                            with Romania and following next with Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
                            Bulgaria. The precise timing would, of course, also depend on the
                            progress registered on outstanding problems and in the atmosphere of
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>As will be seen from the attached outline, the initiation of negotiation
                            on cultural and scientific exchanges is the next step we plan to take
                            with Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. Pursuit of such negotiations
                            with Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria has been postponed over the last few
                            months pending a review of <gloss target="#t_NSSM1">NSSM</gloss>
                                163/<gloss target="#t_CIEPSM1">CIEPSM</gloss> 24 but we now feel, in
                            light of the March 7 meeting, that there is general agreement we should
                            pursue such negotiations, and indicate to these governments that a rapid
                            and successful conclusion will pave the way for negotiations looking
                            towards economic normalization. Inasmuch as we have already
                            satisfactorily concluded a cultural and scientific exchanges agreement
                            with Romania, we plan to proceed next with Hungary, with which we have
                            already exchanged drafts, and then propose drafts to Czechoslovakia and
                            Bulgaria as the current consular convention negotiations with these two
                            countries enter their final phase. We expect that, while we should be
                            able to initial exchanges agreements with these countries, they may
                            insist on delaying signature until <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            is assured.</p>
                        <p>With all four countries, we plan to continue to intensify our
                            recommendations that they promptly initiate or conclude negotiations
                            with the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council looking toward the
                            settlement of defaulted pre-war bonds. With Czechoslovakia, we plan to
                            initiate negotiations of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> claims
                            against Czechoslovakia for nationalized property and the return of
                            Czechoslovak gold. This proposal will be forwarded for <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> review in the near future.</p>
                        <p>We plan to cite our improving relations with Poland <pb n="3"

                            Assistant Secretary Green called in the Ambassadors of Poland and

                            have a bearing on the improvement of our bilateral relations with those

                            and Albania was still somewhat removed and that there are no major

                            these four countries are dealt with in the attachment in a somewhat

                            Instead of a linked sequence of issues for negotiation, a simple listing
                            of the principal issues which remain to be resolved is presented but

                        <p>The House should go along with the Commission's recommendations, but
                                <persName corresp="#p_FJW2">Fulbright</persName> has told Eisenhower
                            he will continue to oppose funding the radios. Other Senate criticism of
                            the report will probably center on its failure to recommend that
                            European governments be approached for operating funds.</p>
                        <p>Next Steps - Scenario</p>
                        <p>We concur in Dr. Eisenhower's recommendation that the report be published
                            and sent to the <persName corresp="#p_HRC1">Hill</persName>.</p>

                        <p>The White House will at the same time release your statement endorsing
                            the proposition that the radios deserve continuing U.S. Government
                            financial support. The proposed statement does not include an
                            endorsement of the specific recommendations of the report.</p>
                        <p>Both the letters to the Congress (Tabs A and B) have been coordinated
                            with Dave Gergen. Bill Timmons concurs in the above scenario.</p>
                        <p>Establishment of the Board</p>
                        <p>This is the sole aspect of the Commission's recommendation on which we do
                            not have a joint position. Since current congressional authority for
                            support of the radios expires June 30, we need to prepare very soon new
                            legislation that either reflects the commission's recommendations or
                            another alternative.</p>
                        <p>As proposed by the Commission, the Board would consist of five members
                            appointed by the President with Senate confirmation and two non-voting
                            representatives of the radios. It would defend budget requests before
                            the Congress, allocate funds to the radios, evaluate their performance,
                            and assure that they operate in a fashion “not inconsistent with” U.S.
                            foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>Pros and Cons</p>
                        <p>State and <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> support the Commission's
                            arguments that establishment of a Board would (a) minimize the impact on
                            our foreign relations of complaints from foreign countries to whom the
                            radios broadcast; (b) meet the radios' apprehensions that their
                            credibility might be compromised by a direct connection with a U.S.
                            foreign policy agency; and yet (c) provide for appropriate foreign
                            policy guidance.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_ARL1">Roy Ash</persName> points out that, during
                            the past two years, first <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss> and now
                            State oversight of the radios has produced no significant adverse
                            effects on either of those agencies or the radios' independence. He
                            believes <pb n="3" xml:id="d5-03" facs="d5-03"/>that the fact of U.S.
                            Government financial support, rather than the particular agency through
                            which funds are administered, is likely to be the decisive criterion
                            when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern European
                            governments consider whether to retaliate against radio broadcasts; and
                            he points out that the proposed Board will be a U.S. Government agency.
                            Domestically, in <persName corresp="#p_ARL1">Ash</persName>'s view, the
                            Board might well tend to repeat the consistent pattern of independent
                            agencies and commissions which take on a life of their own, lobby for
                            increased funds, and become program advocates. In such a case, effective
                            management control and any future decision to reduce or terminate U.S.
                            funds would be severely hampered. Finally, he notes that Congress a year
                            ago failed to enact a similar Administration-backed organizational
                            proposal. He recommends continuation of the present arrangement of State
                            Department responsibility for the radios.</p>

                        <p>(S) A survey of the vulnerability of the Charleston, South Carolina, port
                            area to intelligence collection from shipborne collectors has been
                            completed by the Department of the Navy. As in the case if Hampton
                            Roads, serious security problems were uncovered. Based on the findings
                            of this survey, the Secretary of the Navy has recommended that WARSAW
                            PACT vessels be denied access to the Charleston area. This
                            recommendation was based on the following significant results of the
                            survey: <list>
                                <item>- Charleston is the largest naval complex in the Sixth Naval
                                    district, which comprises virtually all the Southeastern United
                                    States coastal area.</item>
                                <item>- Charleston is homeport for 18 nuclear submarines, 6 diesel
                                    submarines, 17 destroyers of various types, and other Navy
                                    ships.</item>
                                <item>- Charleston is heavily involved in many phases of sensitive
                                    Nuclear Ballistic Missile Submarine (<gloss target="#t_SSBN1"
                                        >SSBN</gloss>) and Nuclear Attack Submarine (<gloss
                                        target="#t_SSN1">SSN</gloss>) activity.</item>
                                <item>- The intelligence collection vessels (<gloss target="#t_AGI1"
                                        >AGI</gloss>'s) which the Soviets deploy to our East Coast
                                    spend more time near Charleston than any other port except
                                    Norfolk. Clandestine intelligence collection vessels in port
                                    would complement the patrolling <gloss target="#t_AGI1"
                                        >AGI</gloss>'s since they could:</item>

                                <item>-- The concentration of nuclear submarines, with several
                                    antenna and hull configurations and in various states of dry
                                    docking and disassembly, provides many unique photographic
                                    intelligence collection opportunities.</item>

                        <p>(S) The Department of the Navy will attempt to correct these
                            vulnerabilities. However, in view of the gross security problems in the
                            Charleston area, it is not possible at this time to estimate: 1) whether
                            corrective action can ever totally eliminate the security problems; 2) a
                            completion date for actions which can be taken.</p>
                        <p>(S) Acting for the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense
                            has concurred with the Secretary of the Navy in his recommendation that
                            access to the Fort of Charleston be denied Warsaw Pact vessels. He has
                            authorized me to take the necessary steps to obtain interdepartmental
                            agreement to close this port not only to Warsaw Pact vessels, but to
                            ships of the Peoples Republic of China as well. Accordingly, I am
                            forwarding this recommendation though you to the Port Security Committee
                            for consideration by that body.</p>
                        <p>(U) If the Committee concurs in this recommendation, the Department of
                            Defense will brief appropriate Congressional leaders and concerned
                            government agencies on the reasons for this decision.</p>

                        <p>In October 1972 you directed an Ad Hoc Group chaired by the Department of
                            State to undertake a comprehensive review of the issues involved in
                            further normalizing our economic relations with the countries of Eastern

                            1973.</p>
                        <p>There was general agreement at the meeting that movement toward economic
                            normalization with Eastern European countries is not only desirable for
                            trade promotion reasons but also affords us opportunities (a) to press
                            for better overall relations; and (b) to complete specific unfinished
                            bilateral business in the financial, cultural-scientific exchanges, and
                            consular areas. State has now drawn up a game plan, including political
                            criteria, to move the various negotiations forward. The game plan
                            reflected in the Decision Memorandum at Tab A is based on the following
                            agreements reached at the SRG meeting: <list>
                                <item>-- Economic and political issues will be linked and progress
                                    in the economic area will be made dependent on satisfactory
                                    political conduct by the Eastern European countries.</item>
                                <item>-- Negotiations will principally involve those countries with
                                    which we already have diplomatic relations but which we have not
                                    normalized economic relations to the extent of extending <gloss

                                    be maintained in our economic negotiations until Congressional

                                    known. This should not, however, preclude our initiating formal

                                    problems of interest to us.</item>
                                <item>-- Negotiation of commercial agreements will start with
                                    Romania to be followed by Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and then
                                    Bulgaria.</item>

                        <p>While there were no major differences of opinion expressed at the Senior
                            Review Group meeting, Commerce, Treasury and Agriculture are not
                            enthusiastic about linking economic with non-economic issues. State and
                            Defense on the other hand believe that conclusion of satisfactory
                            consular and exchanges agreements, settlement of financial claims and
                            defaulted bonds, and an improved atmosphere for the conduct of normal
                            relations should be prerequisites to normalizing commercial relations
                            with countries that do not now benefit from <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> treatment (i. e. Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and Albania).</p>
                        <p>In our view, the strategy favored by State and Defense provides optimum
                            prospects for making progress in both the economic and political areas.
                            It is also it accord with that which we have successfully followed with
                            the Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of China.</p>

                        <p>The President has directed the further study of technical and
                            administrative issues relating, in particular, to safeguard procedures
                            and the means to control the export of technical information, training
                            services, and software. The purpose of these studies will be to
                            determine what measures are effective and economically feasible so that
                            export restraints might then be appropriately modified.</p>
                        <p>The President believes that a reduction in the administrative burden
                            associated with processing license applications for computer exports is
                            needed. Accordingly, he has directed that arrangements be worked out
                            between the Department of Commerce and other Departments to simplify the
                            administrative procedures for processing license applications for
                            computers and associated equipment. The Department of Commerce shall
                            also continue its effort to improve its internal procedures for
                            reviewing computer license applications.</p>
                        <p>The President has directed the preparation of a comprehensive U. S.

                        <p>Moscow's policy of demanding that detente with the West be accompanied by
                            increased discipline and unity in Eastern Europe is causing growing
                            unease and could lead to trouble. There are signs that the policy has
                            caused at least some problems for every regime in the area. The
                            potential for trouble, however, seems greatest in the Balkans with
                            Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia the most likely hot-spots. The situation
                            in Poland and to a somewhat lesser extent, that in Czechoslovakia, will
                            also bear close watching, and we can expect to see some push and tug in

                            sought at the same time to oppose Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe and
                            to increase their own freedom of maneuver within the confines of the

                            there are signs that the irritation level in Moscow is beginning to

                        <p>Bucharest is well aware -- and has told us -- that release of the

                            and the other East European capitals could result. Against this
                            possibility, the Romanians have apparently launched a campaign designed
                            to head off the harshest reactions.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>-- They are deliberately spreading rumors that Bucharest is
                                already under intense pressure from Moscow for pursuing an

                        </list>
                        <p>The circulation of these rumors seems calculated to focus international
                            attention on Bucharest's claimed problems with Moscow. As far as can be
                            determined, for example, there has been no Soviet demand for a corridor.
                            Moscow did, however, propose the construction of a wide-gauge railroad
                            across the Dobrudja to facilitate shipments to Bulgaria. The Romanians
                            refused, but then embroidered on the story for circulation in the world
                            rumor market.</p>
                        <p>In addition to spreading an exaggerated alarm, the Romanians may be
                            counting on coming events to help take the sting out of Moscow's
                            response. A <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>-sponsored conference on
                            world population -- the first ever staged in Eastern Europe by the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> -- will take place in Bucharest
                            during August 19-30. It will be attended by hundreds of delegates and
                            newsmen -- particularly from the West and the Third World -- and will
                            coincide with the 30th anniversary celebrations.</p>
                        <p>-- <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> may well calculate
                            that the presence of so many potentially sympathetic witnesses would
                            inhibit any harsh and precipitate Soviet reaction to the publication of
                            the party programme.</p>
                        <p>But these gambits may not work. There are signs that Moscow is becoming
                            impatient with <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>'s
                            continued courtship of the Chinese, to the point that it broadcast some
                            veiled warnings to Bucharest during foreign minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MG4">Macovescu</persName>'s visit to Peking last week.
                            The Kremlin's irritation over Bucharest's relations with Peking could
                            combine with its negative reaction to the Romanian party programme to
                            bring <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> under more

                            underestimate Soviet reaction while counting too much on moral support
                            from the West.</p>
                        <p>The pressures will be primarily psychological, but if <persName

                            the Soviets could threaten -- and perhaps apply some economic and
                            political sanctions. In the end, the Romanians will have no choice but
                            to get back into line, at least temporarily.</p>

                            well know that they can do nothing that suggests a move away from the
                            Warsaw Pact; to do so would run the grave risk of Soviet military
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>There is, also, an outside possibility that the Soviets might see any

                            to live up to a Warsaw Pact member's obligation to allow troop passage,

                        <p>HUNGARY</p>
                        <p>Our concern over Hungary dates from the severe blow dealt to advocates of
                            the country's liberal economic and cultural policies in the leadership
                            shake-up last March. The fundamental contradiction between detente and
                            discipline, between “liberal” and conservative, was at the root of the
                            problem.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>-- Over several months, the success of Budapest's economic reform
                                and its liberal cultural policies had sparked growing criticism from
                                Moscow and from domestic hard-liners that Hungary was “creeping
                                toward capitalism.”</item>
                            <item>-- When the issue was forced in March, the liberals lost and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_KJ3">Kadar</persName> demoted the chief

                        </list>
                        <p>This created fears in Hungary that Kadarism -- a blend of moderate and
                            paternalistic reform -- would have to take a back seat to Moscow's
                            demands for tightened discipline in Eastern Europe. The party has tried
                            to allay this concern by insisting that only the pace -- and not the
                            content -- of the reforms would be affected.</p>
                        <p>About a month ago, however, reports of instability in the Hungarian
                            leadership began to circulate. Some of the stories say that:</p>

                                that appear to appeal for unity and calm.</item>
                            <item>-- The Hungarian police arrested and quickly released a large
                                number of pro-reform dissidents, presumably as a warning.</item>
                            <item>-- In mid-July, the head of the Soviet KGB requested an “urgent”

                        <p>Despite such rumors, <persName corresp="#p_KJ3">Kadar</persName> still
                            appears to be very much in charge. Last week he returned from a short

                            persistence of rumors of factionalism and political infighting in
                            Budapest may indicate, however, that there is fire behind the smoke.</p>

                        <p>For the last year or two Tito has carefully managed a modest improvement

                            enough bilateral and European-wide benefit from this semi-rapprochement

                            and embodying Titoist socialism in the new constitution, the succession
                            problem is far from settled. The prospects for a smooth transition are
                            good in the short term, but the country's future will depend on how well
                            his successors will work together, whether the federation can survive
                            the strains of traditional regional animosities, and on how successfully
                            the new leaders manage relations with the Soviet Union. The Soviets

                            semi-rapprochement with Moscow will continue and Belgrade will look to
                            the Soviets particularly for arms and economic aid. This effort will be
                            balanced by constant reassurances to Washington that Belgrade will never
                            willingly march back into the Soviet camp.</p>

                            differences remain between them, but Moscow will nevertheless regard any
                            warming of relations between the two Balkan mavericks as a development
                            to be watched carefully.</p>
                        <p>WARSAW PACT AND CEMA STRAINS</p>
                        <p>Moscow's demands for unity and discipline in Eastern Europe have been
                            accompanied by efforts to increase military and economic cohesion in the
                            alliance system as such.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>-- There is evidence that the Soviets are seeking greater control
                                over the military forces of the East European nations.</item>
                            <item>-- Moscow has also renewed its pushing for integration of the East
                                European economies with that of the Soviet Union.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The East Europeans recognize that integration in any sphere is simply
                            another device to undercut their freedom of action in dealing with the
                            West and that it is ultimately designed to ensure Soviet hegemony. To
                            the extent possible, they resist these Soviet efforts -- at least
                            arguing against them in terms of their own national interests. Their
                            foot-dragging may have been behind Moscow's apparent decision to hold
                            bilateral meetings with certain leaders this summer instead of covering
                            the usual “vacation meeting” of all Warsaw Pact leaders in the
                            Crimea.</p>
                        <p>On balance, then, the East Europeans are caught squarely between the need
                            to accommodate Moscow and their desire for better relations with the
                            West. They must tighten control over their own people, and at the same
                            time give them at least some of the material benefits of detente in
                            order to win their support. As they walk this narrow road over the
                            coming months, the chances of a misstep seem greater than at any time in
                            the recent past.</p>

                            <p>I. Background</p>
                            <p>The recent passage of the Trade Reform Act and the Soviet reaction to
                                its emigration provisions, has had the net effect of leaving things
                                the way they were in U.S. relations with the countries of Eastern
                                Europe. For the future this means that we can expect a continuation
                                of the fairly good ties which have developed with Yugoslavia,
                                Romania and, to a lesser degree, Poland, and the possibility of some
                                positive movement in relations with Hungary, Czechoslovakia,
                                Bulgaria and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> as these
                                countries attempt to share in whatever benefits continue to flow
                                from U.S.-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> detente. As for
                                Albania, the hostile immobilisme of the past 30 years will doubtless
                                persist, at least as long as the present leadership is around.</p>
                            <p>This extrapolation of present trends reflects accurately the
                                priorities we have previously established among the Eastern European
                                countries. Put simplest, these priorities are based on the degree to
                                which each Eastern European government has supported U.S. interests
                                world-wide or vis-a-vis the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>.
                                The measure of this support is the extent of independence from
                                Moscow asserted by the separate communist regimes. Thus the
                                objective we have pursued throughout the post-war period of
                                fostering a diminution of Soviet power in Europe remains a
                                fundamental objective of our foreign policy - even in the detente
                                era.</p>

                            <p>The pursuit of this objective is carried out against the backdrop of

                                        and there remain close family ties connecting thousands of
                                        Eastern Europeans with relatives in the West. Detente

                                    <item>A policy change of a fundamental nature has occurred in
                                        the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. This was the decision
                                        to move from the autarkical, Moscow-managed economic system
                                        imposed by Stalin toward a much fuller involvement in the
                                        mainstream of world trade and economic activity. This move
                                        represented a tacit acknowledgment that the old system was
                                        not working and that only injections of technology and cash
                                        from the capitalist world could provide the modernization
                                        and qualitative improvements needed to meet more
                                        sophisticated consumer demands. The authorities would not
                                        wish this involvement to develop to the point of endangering
                                        their control, but the degree of inter-dependence and
                                        diversification is already sufficient to create a shared

                                            Yugoslavia's independent, non-aligned policy is likely
                                            to continue. Our recognition of this situation is in
                                            itself a contribution to stability. As for the future,
                                            we can expect no substantial change in the bumpy but
                                            basically positive relations characteristic of the past
                                            20-25 years. This means continued differences over how
                                            to deal with the developing world, with independence
                                            movements and over the role of military alliances. In
                                            the final analysis, however, an economically strong,
                                            politically independent and stable Yugoslavia is not
                                            only important to our strategic interests in Europe. It

                        <p>NOTE</p>
                        <p>This Estimate is concerned with the Warsaw Pact forces -- primarily
                            ground and tactical air forces located in the European <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe opposite <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. Soviet naval, bomber, and missile
                            forces are treated only insofar as they bear directly on potential
                            European land campaigns. Soviet theater forces opposite China are
                            discussed in NIE 11-13-73, The Sino-Soviet Relationship: The Military
                            Aspects. Details on Soviet general purpose naval forces are contained in
                            NIE 11-15-74, Soviet Naval Policy and Programs. Comprehensive estimates
                            on Soviet strategic attack and defense forces are contained in NIE
                            11-3/8-74, Soviet Forces For Intercontinental Conflict Through 1985.

                        <p>PRINCIPAL JUDGMENTS</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> considers its military strength
                            in Europe to be fundamental to the protection of its national interests,
                            to the maintenance of its strategic posture vis-a-vis the West, and to
                            its management of foreign policy. The Soviets appear committed to
                            maintaining a demonstrable numerical edge over <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> in some key elements of theater forces such as
                            divisions, tanks, artillery, and combat aircraft. They cannot, however,
                            separate Europe from the larger context of the overall theater and
                            strategic resources available to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and the West. We believe that the Soviets, given this
                            larger view of the existing balance, consider both <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact to be deterred
                            from initiating war.</p>
                        <p>Soviet thinking on the nuclear aspects of a war in Europe has changed in
                            the past decade and may still be changing. The Soviets evidently no
                            longer expect that any <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> use of
                            nuclear weapons would necessarily be answered with massive Pact nuclear
                            strikes throughout <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Europe. We
                            estimate that the following considerations characterize current Soviet
                            concepts of the initial stages of a war in Europe: <list>
                                <item>-- The Soviets believe that a war in Europe probably would
                                    begin with both sides using only non-nuclear weapons.</item>
                                <item>-- They also believe that the Pact would quickly contain a
                                    non-nuclear <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> attack, go on
                                    the offensive, and achieve early successes in penetrating <gloss
                                        target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s defenses.</item>
                                <item>-- The Soviets would continue to use only non-nuclear weapons
                                    as long as possible.</item>
                                <item>-- <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> would initiate the
                                    use of nuclear weapons to compel Pact forces to halt their
                                    offensive.</item>
                                <item>-- If <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s initial use of
                                    theater nuclear weapons were selective and limited, we could not
                                    confidently predict the Soviets' response. But they have been
                                    broadening the range of options available to them for
                                    responding. They might continue purely non-nuclear operations.
                                    Or they might launch a massive theater nuclear strike -- the
                                    response which they practice most frequently in exercises. But
                                    we cannot exclude the possibility that they would respond with
                                    limited nuclear strikes of their own -- they have considered
                                    this alternative.</item>
                                <pb n="6" xml:id="d13-06" facs="d13-06"/>
                                <item>-- The Soviets reckon, however, that once nuclear weapons are
                                    introduced by either side, the risk of escalation is very great
                                    because the side that struck first massively would have the

                                    or the other with massive, theater-wide strikes would increase

                            nuclear doctrine and our lack of information by which to judge how
                            Soviet political authorities would respond to a proposal by the Soviet
                            military to use nuclear weapons, we cannot confidently predict how the

                            initiation of nuclear war. But we judge that the odds still favor rapid
                            escalation once nuclear war began in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The Warsaw Pact has some 150 divisions in varying states of strength and

                        <p>The Soviets would expect Central Europe to be the decisive theater of a
                            large-scale <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Warsaw Pact conflict.
                            Whether they would launch offensives all along <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>'s flanks concurrently with any campaign in Central
                            Europe is uncertain. We believe that the Warsaw Pact has the means to
                            conduct limited, but not general, offensive operations in Scandinavia
                            and southern Europe while simultaneously carrying out an offensive
                            against the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> center. We judge that
                            early Pact offensives toward the Turkish Straits and northern Norway are
                            more likely than in the other flank areas such as Italy and the rest of
                            Scandinavia.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets consider it likely that, in the case of a <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>-Pact war, Pact operations --
                            including major offensives -- would begin prior to their carrying out a
                            large-scale reinforcement with ground forces from the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Until about the mid-1960s, the
                            Soviets expected to conduct such a reinforcement in advance of war. This
                            change, which has become apparent in Pact writings and exercise
                            scenarios since the late 1960s, may have occurred because the Soviets no
                            longer count on having the time for prior reinforcement, and also
                            because of the danger that such action could be counterproductive. For
                            example, it might cause <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> to begin a
                            buildup of its own that would work against the Pact's initial numerical
                            superiority of forces in Central Europe. The Soviets may also believe
                            that the reinforcement process is not as severely threatened by <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> nuclear attack as it was in earlier
                            years. This change in doctrine does not necessarily represent a change
                            in Soviet preferences but reflects what is, from their point of view, a
                            prudent planning assumption. This appreciation of Pact offensive
                            concepts has important warning implications for <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>. In particular, we no longer can be confident that the
                            movement of a 25-30 division force from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> into Central Europe would take place before an attack.

                        <p>(1) The Director of Naval Intelligence, Department of the Navy, believes
                            that this inadequately states the attack warning implications. He
                            believes that the Soviets, actively consider attack plans which do not
                            involve the movement of a 25-30 division force from the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to Central Europe before an
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet military evidently believes that Pact ground forces are
                            superior to <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s. They also believe
                            that Pact theater forces now in Central Europe are not only capable of
                            containing a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> attack in the early
                            days of a conflict, but are also capable of conducting a non-nuclear
                            offensive into West Germany. This rapidly advancing offensive would
                            depend on the tank -- Pact forces in Central Europe have some 16,000.
                            The Soviet ground forces are more dependent upon the tank than any army
                            in history. If the Soviets were ever forced to conclude <pb n="8"
                                xml:id="d13-08" facs="d13-08"/>that their tanks were unable to

                            of State, believes that the Soviet military leaders would be far more
                            conservative than the Estimate indicates in their assessment of the
                            balance in Europe and of the ability of Warsaw Pact forces to execute a
                            successful offensive deep into West Germany.</p>
                        <p>Soviet military writings do describe a sequence of first containing a

                            smashing counteroffensive deep into Germany.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of reasons to doubt that Soviet military or political
                            leaders would have confidence in carrying it out with only the forces

                            <item>-- The Soviets have been extremely cautious in reckoning their
                                requirements for any military operation, defensive or offensive.
                                This was vividly demonstrated in the last Soviet military operation
                                in Europe -- the occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1968.</item>
                            <item>-- Numerical force ratios which strongly favor the Soviets may not
                                appear nearly so advantageous in Soviet eyes. The Soviet military
                                leaders would be prone to calculate on a worst-case basis and use
                                assumptions different from the West. If the Soviets assumed that
                                West Germany began to mobilize before the Pact, they would see Pact
                                troops being quickly outnumbered.</item>
                            <item>-- The Soviets, moreover, would be inclined to credit the West
                                with advantages in characteristics of equipment. This appears to be
                                the case especially with aircraft, and there are indications of
                                Soviet apprehensions over the air operation which their strategy
                                projects, as this Estimate points out.</item>
                            <item>-- A further example of conservative thinking was suggested in two
                                exercises in which the Soviets appear to have initiated use of
                                nuclear weapons in order to stop <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> attacks.</item>

                                they were ten and 15 years ago.</item>

                        <p>This view of the Soviet assessment of the chances of success in the
                            operations described in the Estimate suggests that the Soviets would
                            much prefer to reinforce before starting operations in Germany if they
                            could, and that failing such reinforcement they would have substantial
                            doubts over their capability to launch an offensive deep into West
                            Germany. The reason for practicing initiation of operations before
                            reinforcement appears to be a Soviet judgment that there may not in fact
                            be time to bring forces forward before the war starts.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets probably consider that <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>'s tactical air forces could blunt or perhaps even halt
                            this Pact ground offensive. Because of this, the Pact evidently plans a
                            massive, theater-wide offensive during the initial, non-nuclear phase of
                            a war aimed at destroying <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s
                            tactical air forces and other nuclear systems and facilities. This
                            attack is to be conducted by tactical aircraft, and by bombers of Soviet
                            Long Range and possibly Naval Aviation. The all-out nature of this
                            scheme and deficiencies in the capabilities of most Pact aircraft would
                            make it a highly risky operation, its success depending heavily on
                            surprise to insure that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s air
                            defenses are not fully prepared and mobile nuclear systems not
                            dispersed.</p>
                        <p>The quantity of Pact tactical nuclear delivery systems has been
                            increasing in recent years, and this would enable the Soviets to conduct
                            nuclear warfare in Europe at higher intensities before having to use <pb
                                n="9" xml:id="d13-09" facs="d13-09"/>their <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>-based systems. There is, however, no direct evidence
                            that they are deliberately seeking an alternative to using their <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>-based nuclear forces in large-scale
                            theater nuclear war. Available evidence, although inconclusive, suggests
                            that the Soviets have nuclear weapons in Eastern Europe, but we can only
                            roughly approximate how many nuclear weapons might be stored in the
                            likely storage facilities.</p>
                        <p>Soviet military doctrine categorizes toxic chemical agents along with
                            nuclear weapons as “weapons of mass destruction” and implies that the
                            Pact would use chemical weapons once nuclear weapons were in use. We
                            have little doubt that the Soviets possess substantial stocks of toxic
                            chemical agents but cannot estimate the size of their stockpile. We have
                            good evidence, however, that some toxic chemical munitions are available
                            to Soviet air forces in Eastern Europe. Pact forces emphasize training
                            and equipment for defense against chemical and radiological effects and
                            we judge they could operate in a CBR environment more effectively than
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> forces.</p>

                                <item>-- In the ground forces, the numbers of tanks and artillery
                                    pieces have been substantially increased and a variety of other
                                    changes in organization and equipment have brought larger and
                                    more modern divisions. Motor transport capability has been added
                                    not only to supply ammunition for the added weapons, but also to
                                    improve overall logistic capability. Modern ground-based air
                                    defense systems are being assigned to the ground forces in large
                                    numbers. Technical improvements, particularly in air defense and
                                    artillery weapons, and the improvements to the APCs also
                                    contribute to greater theater force capabilities. Despite these
                                    improvements, however, ground force units still have a mixture
                                    of old and new equipment and some units in the <gloss

                                    shortages.</item>
                                <item>-- The Soviet tactical air forces opposite <gloss
                                        target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> have remained relatively
                                    stable in numbers but have begun acquiring a new generation of
                                    aircraft and weapons that is enabling them to change their
                                    traditional air defense orientation toward a broader range of
                                    offensive as well as defensive missions. But the full
                                    realization of these possibilities is still some way off.
                                    Despite the acquisition of some new aircraft with capabilities
                                    similar to the better <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                    aircraft, the majority of Soviet and East European tactical
                                    aircraft still have short ranges and low payloads and lack the
                                    sophisticated weaponry and avionics of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                        >US</gloss> aircraft.</item>

                        <p>We have recently acquired a piece of evidence that suggests the Soviets
                            have, or plan to have, nuclear artillery rounds.</p>
                        <p>In the East European forces, reorganization, expansion, and force
                            modernization has allowed them to assume greater responsibilities in
                            Pact military plans. Although improvements in East European ground
                            forces have generally followed the Soviet lead, they have tended to lag
                            by a few years and to proceed more gradually.</p>
                        <p>The momentum of the Soviet drive to maintain superiority of theater
                            forces in Europe seems likely to lead to gradual expansion and further
                            technological improvements in Soviet theater forces through the end of
                            the 1970s. (3) If the trend of the last two years or so continues, the
                            overall size of the Soviet theater forces will increase by about 100,000
                            men by the early 1980s, when they would then have a total of more than
                            2.1 million.</p>

                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">HARTMAN</persName>: I have asked Hal to
                            lead our discussion this morning on Eastern European issues.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">SONNENFELDT</persName>: I would like to
                            couch my remarks this morning in a very broad perspective because many
                            of you from the Eastern European posts will have the opportunity to meet
                            in a smaller group to deal with specific issues.</p>
                        <p>I start from the premise, the historic fact that we are witnessing the
                            emergence of the Soviet Union as a super power on a global scale. This
                            will be a long-term process. It is a process that is just beginning in
                            global terms as the Soviets are just now breaking out of their
                            continental mold. They are just now developing modalities for carrying
                            out such a global policy.</p>
                        <p>The reason why it is possible for the United States and its Western
                            European allies to develop the policies that will allow us to cope with
                            this situation is that Soviet power is developing irregularly. It is
                            subject to flaws and to requirements which in some cases only the
                            outside world can meet.</p>
                        <p>Their thrust as an imperial power comes at a time well after that period
                            when the last imperial power, Germany, made the plunge, and it hence
                            comes at a time when different rules and perceptions apply. The Soviets
                            have been inept. They have not been able to bring the attractions that
                            past imperial powers brought to their conquests. They have not brought
                            the ideological, legal, cultural, architectural, organizational and
                            other values and skills that characterized the British, French and
                            German adventures. None of these things have been a hallmark of the
                            Soviet emergence as an imperial power.</p>
                        <p>In addition, there are serious underlying pressures and tensions in the
                            Soviet system itself. The base from which imperialism asserts itself has
                            serious problems in the economic and social sectors. There are also
                            internal nationalist groups which are growing. Non-Russian nationalist
                            groups in Russia are growing at a disproportionally faster rate and
                            which will add to these tensions in the base whence springs Soviet
                            imperialism.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d14-03" facs="d14-03"/>
                        <p>The Soviets have been particularly unskilled in building viable
                            international structures. They have nothing approaching the European
                            Community or the many other successful Western institutions. In Eastern
                            Europe particularly, the single most important unifying force is the
                            presence of sheer Soviet military power. There has been no development
                            of a more viable, organic structure. If anything, the last thirty years
                            have intensified the urges in Eastern European countries for autonomy,
                            for identity. There has been an intensification of the desire to break
                            out of the Soviet straitjacket. This has happened in every Eastern
                            European country to one degree or another. There are almost no genuine
                            friends of the Soviets left in Eastern Europe, except possibly
                            Bulgaria.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets' inability to acquire loyalty in Eastern Europe is an
                            unfortunate historical failure because Eastern Europe is within their
                            scope and area of natural interest. It is doubly tragic that in this
                            area of vital interest and crucial importance it has not been possible
                            for the Soviet Union to establish roots of interest that go beyond sheer
                            power.</p>
                        <p>It is, therefore, important to remember that the main, if not the only,
                            instrument of Soviet imperialism has been power.</p>
                        <p>The reason we can today talk and think in terms of dealing with Soviet
                            imperialism, outside of and in addition to simple confrontation, is
                            precisely because Soviet power is emerging in such a flawed way. This
                            gives us the time to develop and to react. There is no way to prevent
                            the emergence of the Soviet Union as a superpower. When viewed in terms
                            of the historical flows that are accompanying the emergence of the
                            Soviet Union as a superpower it is inevitable that this will happen.</p>
                        <p>What we can do is affect the way in which that power is developed and
                            used. Not only can we balance it in the traditional sense but we can
                            affect its usage -- and that is what detente is all about.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Eastern Europe, it seems to me that it must be in our
                            long-term interest to so influence events in this area -- because of the
                            present unnatural relationship with the Soviet Union -- so that they
                            will not sooner <pb n="4" xml:id="d14-04" facs="d14-04"/>or later
                            explode, causing WW III. I consider this inorganic, unnatural
                            relationship to be a far greater danger to world peace than the conflict
                            between East and West. There is one qualification to this statement. If
                            Western Europe becomes so concerned with its economic and social
                            problems that an imbalance develops, then perhaps the dangers to the
                            United States' interests will he endangered by the simple change in the
                            balance of power.</p>
                        <p>So, it must be our policy to strive for an evolution that makes the
                            relationship between the Eastern Europeans and the Soviet Union an
                            organic one. Our policy should be the Finlandization of Eastern Europe.
                            Any excess of zeal on our part is bound to produce results that could
                            reverse the desired process for a period of time, even though in my view
                            the process would remain inevitable within the next 100 years. But, of
                            course, for us that is too long a time to wait.</p>
                        <p>So, our policy must be a policy of responding to the clearly visible
                            aspirations in Eastern Europe for a more autonomous existence within the
                            context of a strong Soviet geopolitical influence. This has worked in
                            Poland. They have been able to overcome their romantic political
                            inclinations which led to their disasters in the past. They have been
                            skillful in developing a policy that is satisfying their needs for a
                            national identity without arousing Soviet reactions. It is a long
                            process and one in which I am pleased to say we have been able, partly
                            through the help of two Ambassadors at this table today, to skillfully
                            participate.</p>
                        <p>A similar process is now going on in Hungary. <persName corresp="#p_KJ3"
                                >Janos Kadar</persName>'s performance has been remarkable in finding
                            ways which are acceptable to the Soviet Union which develop Hungarian
                            roots and the natural aspirations of the people. He has conducted a
                            number of experiments in the social and economic areas. To a large
                            degree he has been able to do this because the Soviets have four
                            divisions in Hungary and, therefore, have not been overly concerned. He
                            has skillfully used their presence as a security blanket for the
                            Soviets, in a way that has been advantageous to the development of his
                            own country.</p>
                        <p>The Romanian picture is different as one would expect from their
                            different history. The Romanians have striven for autonomy but they have
                            been less daring and innovative in their domestic systems. They remain
                            among the most rigid countries in the internal organization of their
                            system.</p>

                        <p>Without taking a grand tour of countries, I have been trying to
                            illustrate the way in which we see our policies. We seek to influence
                            the emergence of the Soviet imperial power by making the base more
                            natural and organic so that it will not remain founded in sheer power
                            alone. I recognize the arguments that we are helping the Soviets
                            maintain their control over Eastern Europe. I would again argue that
                            there is no alternative open to us other than that of influencing the
                            way Soviet power is used.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">HARTMAN</persName>: Thanks, Hal. I think
                            this has, been one of the most comprehensive analyses of the situation
                            that I have heard. I would like to make one comment, if I may, on Soviet
                            power in the world. There is an irony which is that their system seems
                            more attractive in the world as a whole. When people adopt authoritarian
                            forms of government, for instance in places in Africa, that sort of
                            government can be cloaked in the language of ideology. The
                            justifications for the Soviet system can buttress the natural
                            inclinations of some of these other governments. And there is another
                            irony. In Western Europe, there are those who think that there are
                            benefits in the development of communism in their societies, which is
                            different from the East, where they have seen the system at work, and
                            have, therefore, tried to adapt some of the ways things are done in the
                            West. I think this is a worthwhile observation, and that we need not be
                            so defensive.</p>
                        <p>AMB. <persName corresp="#p_REL1">RICHARDSON</persName>: Hal, I was
                            wondering if you might clarify something. It seems that the Soviet
                            system is incapable of power-sharing, that it cannot decentralize, and
                            that it lacks internal security or the ability to control the transfer
                            of power. How can a society or regime like that become organic if they
                            have failed internally? And I don't see how they can let the states on
                            their border develop faster than they themselves can develop. How do you
                            visualize the more organic evolution process you describe?</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">SONNENFELDT</persName>: It all depends on
                            the Soviets. They have acceded to some innovations, although not as much
                            as the East Europeans who have in some instances been more daring that
                            the Soviet Union, for instance in Poland and Hungary. But you are right.
                            The key to it is in Moscow. That's why I keep harping on the same theme
                            as I did yesterday. If we continue to be preoccupied with containment as
                            we were in the 40s and 50s and ignore the leverage available to us, then
                            we are on the wrong track. <pb n="6" xml:id="d14-06" facs="d14-06"/>The
                            Soviet Union is no longer hermetically sealed as it used to be. They
                            recognize the need for a world system, and the industrialized nations
                            need to use this opportunity to affect this development. I don't mean
                            that we should be involved in Kremlin politics, but there are other
                            openings, and we should reach in, and encourage the development of
                            complexity in the system.</p>
                        <p>Again, as I have said, the argument in Washington is, “How can you permit
                            yourselves to help these people, or why help your enemy? You're just
                            building up their power.” Well, if you have that attitude, you're lost.
                            But if you don't share that attitude, then there is an historic
                            opportunity to affect in some way this giant as it emerges on the
                            international scene. So I agree with your premise. There is the
                            possibility of a Finlandization in Eastern Europe, so we need to
                            approach these problems with enormous care and responsibility, most of
                            all among East Europeans themselves. And there must be restraint in the
                            West.</p>
                        <p>I should say a word about <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss> in this
                            regard. Here is an issue in which we have done ourselves enormous
                            injustice. You know that I was unenthusiastic about the whole process of
                                <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss>, the Secretary had misgivings
                            also. But we got involved for a number of reasons, not the least of
                            which was that the East Europeans wanted it. But if words can do
                            anything, then <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss> recognized a need
                            for change. It did not recognize Soviet hegemony. There is nothing in
                            the document about hegemony, and the Soviets are slowly discovering
                            that. Why the American press wanted to deprive President Ford of a
                            platform to preach and proclaim American commitment to an organic
                            evolution, I don't know. I never understood it, or why this was called a
                            concession to <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>. I just
                            don't understand. It is a self-inflicted wound that is totally
                            unnecessary. So <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss> follow-up should be seen in this
                            broad context that I've outlined, and should be applied to particular
                            countries in particular ways. It requires a sense of nuance. Dean Rusk
                            used to say that we should treat Communist countries differently. And we
                            must understand how they are different, and from that be able to apply
                                <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>AMB. <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">STOESSEL</persName>: I have a few
                            random comments on Hal's perceptive presentation.</p>
                        <p>First, on the Soviet system itself, I think he is right that there has
                            been an evolution and growth of <pb n="7" xml:id="d14-07" facs="d14-07"
                            />confidence. I certainly have sensed this evolution. It is clear to me,
                            since my first assignment there in 1947, that there has been a
                            tremendous change. The society is evolving, although slowly, and the
                            Soviets do not have an overwhelming self-confidence for obvious reasons;
                            but their accomplishments have been impressive and they are gaining a
                            sense of confidence. They still have an underlying sense of inferiority
                            to the West. I have also been impressed with the influence in the Soviet
                            Union of events and conditions in Eastern Europe. This influence is
                            obvious to those who visit Poland or East Germany or Hungary where they
                            see higher standards there and comparatively more freedom. They go there
                            by the millions and they come back with these impressions.</p>
                        <p>On Soviet imperialism, I think Hal's remarks were excellent. The greatest
                            manifestation of this imperialism is in the Soviet Union itself. They
                            have problems with the various nationalities within the Union, but
                            they've done a lot there as well. When you visit same of the Central
                            Asian republics, you often find that the situation there is better than
                            across the border in Iran or Afghanistan. In fact, it can be impressive.
                            We do not have a very good understanding of the nationalist thrust in
                            the Soviet Union, but I can't see serious separatist activities there.
                            They will probably focus on economic or perhaps cultural matters, but
                            not serious political problems which are not terribly acute anyway.</p>
                        <p>Hal stressed the importance of Soviet power and dominance in Eastern
                            Europe. The Soviets are becoming more sure of themselves as they
                            industrialize. And the East Europeans are coming to rely on the Soviet
                            Union for materials so that the Soviet Union is increasingly in a
                            position to control those countries in that way. There has been evidence
                            in Moscow of some increased efforts to tighten relations with the East
                            Europeans, especially after <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss>, to
                            seal them off from the pressures of <gloss target="#t_CSCE1"
                                >CSCE</gloss>. At the same time, the East European countries are
                            reaching out to the West, which the Soviets are not opposing as much as
                            we might have guessed. It is not necessarily a contradiction, Soviet
                            control as opposed to East European contact with the West. In fact, the
                            surer they are of their control, they may even see that contact as an
                            advantage.</p>

                        <p>AMB. <persName corresp="#p_AME2">AUSTAD</persName>: I know it has become
                            something of a cliche, but I object to the use of the word
                            “Finlandization.” It is overused. I can't relate the democracy that I
                            have seen in Finland with socialist authoritarianism, so I don't think
                            the word is right.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">SONNENFELDT</persName>: I only use it in
                            the security of this room.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">HARTMAN</persName>: I agree that it is a
                            word we should not use too often.</p>
                        <p>AMB. <persName corresp="#p_AME2">AUSTAD</persName>: It's just that there
                            is a very good democracy there.</p>
                        <p>AMB. <persName corresp="#p_DRT1">DAVIES</persName>: I would like to see
                            what we see in Finland now elsewhere, perhaps in 30 or 40 years. The
                            people in East Europe do not resent their security relationship with the
                            Soviet Union; they resent being told to be communists.</p>
                        <p>AMB. <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">HILLENBRAND</persName>: I was struck
                            between the similarity in Hal's presentation and the sophisticated
                            justification for the old arguments of Ostpolitik.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">SONNENFELDT</persName>: Whose was more
                            sophisticated, Marty?</p>
                        <p>AMB. <persName corresp="#p_HMJA1">HILLENBRAND</persName>: They are
                            equally sophisticated. The argument in Ostpolitik was to create
                            attractive conditions for the traditional expansion of German influence
                            in Eastern Europe. In inducing this gradual change in Eastern Europe, we
                            should work closely with the West Europeans, and there are certain
                            aberrational tendencies there, for instance with the Germans. There is a
                            feeling that they alone can influence these conditions in Eastern
                            Europe. I think your rationale and analysis are akin to what East Europe
                            is doing.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">SONNENFELDT</persName>: I agree with your
                            emphasis on the need for harmony between the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and the other industrialized nations. There is nothing
                            worse than German illusions that their industrial largesse will do it. A
                            precondition for any of this is a power base on our own side. The
                            weakness of Ostpolitik was that it was not anchored in the alliance
                            system. If we're weak, then we're going to be lost no matter how
                            sophisticated our reasoning is. A strong power base is an indispensable
                            condition, and we must be able to balance Soviet power physically. I
                            proceed from that premise. Without it, the critics are right, and
                            without it, the policy would produce the time-honored Soviet reaction of
                            going for power and power alone. <pb n="9" xml:id="d14-09" facs="d14-09"
                            />But I would agree that some thoughts in Ostpolitik are not dissimilar.
                            It's just that we do it better than when they do it.</p>
                        <p>AMB. <persName corresp="#p_DRT1">DAVIES</persName>: I think it is
                            extremely important to bear in mind that we do not initiate what is
                            going to happen in East Europe. We must be responsive to developments
                            there and do what the leaders think is feasible. We can't rush it. We
                            have to rely on the East European leadership's best estimate of what is
                            possible, and also what is in our interest. They should know best how
                            far they can go and we must be guided by that.</p>
                        <p>AMB. STRAUSZ-HUPE: Of late, I have been sitting at the feet of my Chinese
                            colleague. His analysis is that the structure of the Soviet Union is
                            beyond repair and, therefore, cannot be transformed into an organic
                            whole. Therefore, and now I am quoting him exactly, a Soviet attack on
                            Western Europe is imminent. I presume that behind this theory, expressed
                            by my Chinese colleague, are more detailed considerations. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">Bruce</persName>, I wonder if you can
                            tell us how the Chinese view this process, not only in Western Europe,
                            but in Eastern Europe as well.</p>
                        <p>AMB. <persName corresp="#p_BDKE1">BRUCE</persName>: I don't think I can
                            add much to what your Chinese colleague told you. The Chinese never
                            permit indiscretions by their officials abroad and only very
                            occasionally at home. Their central message is clear. They want to
                            engage as much as possible the attention of the United States to build
                            up its defense against a potential attack by the Soviet Union. They are
                            worried about increasing Soviet power, and they have every reason to be
                            worried. But their concern, though partly ideological, is principally in
                            looking after Chinese national interests. Those interests are to divert
                            the attention of the Soviet Union to the West and from the East.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">HARTMAN</persName>: Are there any other
                            comments? I am rather surprised that our Eastern European colleagues
                            have not asked us about differentiation in our policy but that may be
                            less of a problem in our post-Helsinki situation. We can get into that
                            at lunch.</p>
                        <p>AMB. <persName corresp="#p_SLH1">SILBERMAN</persName>: I would like to
                            ask how he sees relations with Yugoslavia in the period ahead.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d14-10" facs="d14-10"/>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">SONNENFELDT</persName>: I think we and
                            the Western Europeans, indeed the Eastern Europeans as well, have an
                            interest which borders on the vital for us in continuing the
                            independence of Yugoslavia from Soviet domination. Of course we accept
                            that Yugoslav behavior will continue to be, as it has been in the past,
                            influenced and constrained by Soviet power, but any shift back by
                            Yugoslavia into the Soviet orbit would represent a major strategic
                            set-back for the West. I should say here that I don't accept the
                            argument by some that this eventuality is just what is needed to
                            revitalize the non-Communist forces in Italy. I think it would have
                            exactly the opposite effect. So we are concerned about what will happen
                            when Tito disappears, and it is worrying us a good deal. We have had
                            discussions, informal ones, with some of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> friends and have agreed that our policies should be
                            directed to provide as much deterrent as possible ahead of time. I would
                            also emphasize that any idea that with Tito's departure, there should be
                            a concerted Western effort to orient Yugoslavia to the West would be
                            seen by the Soviet Union as exacting its vital interests and would
                            solicit a strong response. So our basic policy continues to be that
                            which we have pursued since 1948-1949, keeping Yugoslavia in a position
                            of substantial independence from the Soviet Union. Now at the same time
                            we would like them to be less obnoxious, and we should allow them to get
                            away with very little. We should especially disabuse them of any notion
                            that our interests in their relative independence is greater than their
                            own and, therefore, they have a free ride. I am sure that you, Larry,
                            will find ways to remind them in this regard--I have in mind Puerto
                            Rico, Panama and the like.</p>
                        <p>AMB. <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">COOPER</persName>: This is the first
                            meeting of this kind I have attended and I have listened carefully to
                            the political and economic concepts outlined here. It seems to me that
                            East/West detente depends on time. Today, looking at it from the
                            outside, it seems we have made some successes in the past several years.
                            But there have also been setbacks. I detect a growing feeling of
                            confidence on the part of the Soviet Union, and this is reflected in the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Fear is also certainly part of
                            it. But if there is a retrogression in detente, what do we do
                            now--especially with regard to Eastern Europe?</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d14-11" facs="d14-11"/>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">HARTMAN</persName>: We will be discussing
                            at lunch the tools we have at hand. As the Secretary and Hal have
                            indicated, we are handicapped by the lack of a trade instrumentality but
                            we do have other means, both government and private, to influence to
                            some extent their behavior.</p>
                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">SONNENFELDT</persName>: I would like to
                            make one comment, <persName>John</persName>, if I may, concerning your
                            question -- your question of how detente is doing. I frankly confess I
                            don't like the question itself because I think it evades the central
                            issue we are trying to pose. That is, what do you do in the face of
                            increasing Soviet power. We will be facing this increased power if our
                            relationship with the Russians is sweet or our relationship with the
                            Russians is sour. As the Secretary has said, the day when the U.S. could
                            choose its preferences from two alternatives is over. That is, turning
                            our back on the world -- usually behind the protection of another power
                            like the British Navy -- or engaging the world. That choice no longer
                            exists for us. There is too much power in the world for us to ignore,
                            not just the Soviets, but other industrial powers, raw material
                            producers, and even the combined political power of the dwarf states.
                            Nor do we today have enough power to simply overwhelm these problems. So
                            the Soviets will be seen and heard on the world stage no matter what we
                            do. Therefore, the question of whether or not detente is up or down at a
                            particular moment is largely irrelevant. We Americans like to keep score
                            cards, but the historic challenge of the Soviet Union will not go away
                            and the problem of coping with the effects of that growing Soviet power
                            also won't go away. As the Secretary said, we don't have any alternative
                            except to come to grips with the various forms of power which surround
                            us in the world. We have to get away from seeing detente as a process
                            which appeases or propitiates Soviet power. We have to see our task as
                            managing or domesticating this power. That is our central problem in the
                            years ahead, not finding agreements to sign or atmospheres to improve,
                            although those have some effect. Our challenge is how to live in a world
                            with another super power, and anticipate the arrival of a third super
                            power, China, in twenty years or so.</p>

                        <p>MR. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">HARTMAN</persName>: One final conclusion.
                            Hal, and to some extent the Secretary, have complained about criticism
                            of our policies toward the Soviet Union elsewhere. That is the principal
                            reason for the Secretary's swings around the United States and the
                            series of speeches he has been making. Unless there is basic support for
                            these policies in the U.S., no amount of convincing intellectual
                            analyses will be enough. It will not replace broad public support. I
                            would, therefore, hope that all of you when you return to the U.S., when
                            you see friends in Congress, you will try to follow these lines of
                            argument you have heard this weekend and the analyses which support
                            those lines.</p>
                        <p>Finally, in conclusion, I would like to thank all of you for taking part
                            in this conference and for your work and contribution to its success. I
                            have found it interesting and worth doing. I also want to thank
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_REL1">Richardson</persName> and his
                            staff for the magnificent job they have done in organizing our stay here

                        <p>2. BEGIN SUMMARY. WE ARE WITNESSING THE EMERGENCE OF THE SOVIET UNION AS
                            A SUPER POWER ON A GLOBAL SCALE. THIS WILL BE A LONG-TERM PROCESS. IT IS
                            A PROCESS THAT IS JUST BEGINNING IN GLOBAL TERMS AS THE SOVIETS ARE JUST
                            NOW BREAKING OUT OF THEIR CONTINENTAL MOLD. THEY ARE JUST NOW DEVELOPING
                            MODALITIES FOR CARRYING OUT SUCH A GLOBAL POLICY.</p>
                        <p>3. THE REASON WHY IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE UNITED STATES AND ITS WESTERN
                            EUROPEAN ALLIES TO DEVELOP THE POLICIES THAT WILL ALLOW US TO COPE WITH
                            THIS SITUATION IS THAT SOVIET</p>

                        <p>POWER IS DEVELOPING IRREGULARLY. IT IS SUBJECT TO FLAWS AND TO
                            REQUIREMENTS WHICH IN SOME CASES ONLY THE OUTSIDE WORLD CAN MEET.</p>
                        <p>4. THEIR THRUST AS AN IMPERIAL POWER COMES AT A TIME WELL AFTER THAT
                            PERIOD WHEN THE LAST IMPERIAL POWER, GERMANY, MADE THE PLUNGE, AND IT
                            HENCE COMES AT A TIME WHEN DIFFERENT RULES AND PERCEPTIONS APPLY. THE
                            SOVIETS HAVE BEEN INEPT. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRING THE
                            ATTRACTIONS THAT PAST IMPERIAL POWERS BROUGHT TO THEIR CONQUESTS. THEY
                            HAVE NOT BROUGHT THE IDEOLOGICAL, LEGAL, CULTURAL, ARCHITECTURAL,
                            ORGANIZATIONAL AND OTHER VALUES AND SKILLS THAT CHARACTERIZED THE
                            BRITISH, FRENCH AND GERMAN ADVENTURES.</p>
                        <p>5. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE SERIOUS UNDERLYING PRESSURES AND TENSIONS IN
                            THE SOVIET SYSTEM ITSELF. THE BASE FROM WHICH IMPERIALISM ASSERTS ITSELF
                            HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SECTORS. THERE ARE ALSO
                            INTERNAL NATIONALIST GROUPS WHICH ARE GROWING. NON-RUSSIAN NATIONALIST
                            GROUPS IN RUSSIA ARE GROWING AT A DISPROPORTIONALLY FASTER RATE, WHICH
                            WILL ADD TO THESE TENSIONS IN THE BASE WHENCE SPRINGS SOVIET
                            IMPERIALISM.</p>
                        <p>6. THE SOVIETS HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY UNSKILLED IN BUILDING VIABLE
                            INTERNATIONAL STRUCTURES. THEY HAVE NOTHING APPROACHING THE EUROPEAN
                            COMMUNITY OR THE MANY OTHER SUCCESSFUL WESTERN INSTITUTIONS. IN EASTERN
                            EUROPE PARTICULARLY, THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT UNIFYING FORCE IS THE
                            PRESENCE OF SHEER SOVIET MILITARY POWER. THERE HAS BEEN NO DEVELOPMENT
                            OF A MORE VIABLE, ORGANIC STRUCTURE. IF ANYTHING, THE LAST THIRTY YEARS
                            HAVE INTENSIFIED THE URGES IN EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FOR AUTONOMY,
                            FOR IDENTITY. THERE HAS BEEN AN INTENSIFICATION OF THE DESIRE TO BREAK
                            OUT OF THE SOVIET STRAIT-JACKET. THIS HAS HAPPENED IN EVERY EASTERN
                            EUROPEAN COUNTRY TO ONE DEGREE OR ANOTHER. THERE ARE ALMOST NO GENUINE
                            FRIENDS OF THE SOVIETS LEFT IN EASTERN EUROPE, EXCEPT POSSIBLY
                            BULGARIA.</p>
                        <p>7. THE SOVIETS' INABILITY TO ACQUIRE LOYALTY IN EASTERN</p>
                        <p>SECRET</p>
                        <p>PAGE 03 STATE 024976</p>
                        <p>EUROPE IS AN UNFORTUNATE HISTORICAL FAILURE BECAUSE EASTERN EUROPE IS
                            WITHIN THEIR SCOPE AND AREA OF NATURAL INTEREST. IT IS DOUBLY TRAGIC
                            THAT IN THIS AREA OF VITAL INTEREST AND CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE IT HAS NOT
                            BEEN POSSIBLE FOR THE SOVIET UNION TO ESTABLISH ROOTS OF INTEREST THAT
                            GO BEYOND SHEER POWER.</p>
                        <p>8. IT IS, THEREFORE, IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE MAIN, IF NOT THE
                            ONLY, INSTRUMENT OF SOVIET IMPERIALISM HAS BEEN POWER.</p>
                        <p>9. THE REASON WE CAN TODAY TALK AND THINK IN TERMS OF DEALING WITH SOVIET
                            IMPERIALISM, OUTSIDE OF AND IN ADDITION TO SIMPLE CONFRONTATION, IS
                            PRECISELY BECAUSE SOVIET POWER IS EMERGING IN SUCH A FLAWED WAY. THIS
                            GIVES <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> THE TIME TO DEVELOP AND TO
                            REACT. THERE IS NO WAY TO PREVENT THE EMERGENCE OF THE SOVIET UNION AS A
                            SUPERPOWER. WHAT WE CAN DO IS AFFECT THE WAY IN WHICH THAT POWER IS
                            DEVELOPED AND USED. NOT ONLY CAN WE BALANCE IT IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE
                            BUT WE CAN AFFECT ITS USAGE -- AND THAT IS WHAT DETENTE IS ALL
                            ABOUT.</p>
                        <p>10. IT IS OFTEN ASKED HOW DETENTE IS DOING. THE QUESTION ITSELF EVADES
                            THE CENTRAL ISSUE WE ARE TRYING TO POSE. THAT IS, WHAT DO YOU DO IN THE
                            FACE OF INCREASING SOVIET POWER? WE WILL BE FACING THIS INCREASED POWER
                            IF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE RUSSIANS IS SWEET OR OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH
                            THE RUSSIANS IS SOUR. THE DAY WHEN THE U.S. COULD CHOOSE ITS PREFERENCES
                            FROM TWO ALTERNATIVES IS OVER: THAT IS, TURNING OUR BACK ON THE WORLD --
                            USUALLY BEHIND THE PROTECTION OF ANOTHER POWER LIKE THE BRITISH NAVY --
                            OR CHANGING THE WORLD. THAT CHOICE NO LONGER EXISTS FOR <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. THERE IS TOO MUCH POWER IN THE WORLD FOR
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> TO IGNORE, NOT JUST THE SOVIETS,
                            BUT OTHER INDUSTRIAL POWERS, RAW MATERIAL PRODUCERS, AND EVEN THE
                            COMBINED POLITICAL POWER OF THE DWARF STATES. NOR DO WE TODAY HAVE
                            ENOUGH POWER TO SIMPLY OVERWHELM THESE PROBLEMS.</p>
                        <p>11. SO THE SOVIETS WILL BE SEEN AND HEARD ON THE WORLD STAGE NO MATTER
                            WHAT WE DO. THEREFORE, THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT DETENTE IS UP OR
                            DOWN AT A PARTICULAR</p>
                        <p>SECRET</p>

                        <p>MOMENT IS LARGELY IRRELEVANT. WE AMERICANS LIKE TO KEEP SCORE CARDS, BUT
                            THE HISTORIC CHALLENGE OF THE SOVIET UNION WILL NOT GO AWAY AND THE
                            PROBLEM OF COPING WITH THE EFFECTS OF THAT GROWING SOVIET POWER ALSO
                            WON'T GO AWAY. WE DON'T HAVE ANY ALTERNATIVE EXCEPT TO COME TO GRIPS
                            WITH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF POWER WHICH SURROUND <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> IN THE WORLD. WE HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM SEEING DETENTE AS
                            A PROCESS WHICH APPEASES OR PROPITIATES SOVIET POWER. WE HAVE TO SEE OUR
                            TASK AS MANAGING OR DOMESTICATING THIS POWER. THAT IS OUR CENTRAL
                            PROBLEM IN THE YEARS AHEAD, NOT FINDING AGREEMENTS TO SIGN OR
                            ATMOSPHERES TO IMPROVE, ALTHOUGH THOSE HAVE SOME EFFECT. OUR CHALLENGE
                            IS HOW TO LIVE IN A WORLD WITH ANOTHER SUPER POWER, AND ANTICIPATE THE
                            ARRIVAL OF A THIRD SUPER POWER, CHINA, IN TWENTY YEARS OR SO.</p>
                        <p>12. THE DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES ON DETENTE IS ILLUSTRATED BY COMMENTS
                            THAT SOVIET TRADE IS A ONE-WAY STREET.</p>
                        <p>IT SFEMS THAT TODAY YOU CAN'T JUST GET PAYMENT FOR THE GOODS YOU SELL --
                            YOU MUST GET JEWISH EMIGRATION, OR ARMS RESTRAINT, OR ANY NUMBER OF
                            OTHER THINGS.</p>
                        <p>13. OUR EUROPEAN FRIENDS HAVE EXTENDED CONSIDERABLE CREDIT TO THE SOVIETS
                            AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHILE THE <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> DOES NOT EXTEND LINES OF CREDIT BUT RATHER APPROVES
                            FINANCING ON THE BASIS OF EACH PROJECT. THAT FEATURE GIVES <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> SOME CONTROL OVER THE DIRECTION OF SOVIET
                            ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THE EUROPEANS HAVE SURRENDERED ON THIS POINT.
                            WHILE NOT FALLING INTO THE TRADE TRAP, WE HAVE SEEN TRADE AS A SET OF
                            INSTRUMENTALITIES TO ADDRESS THE SET OF PROBLEMS WE FACE WITH THE
                            SOVIETS. WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO DEVELOP A COHERENT TRADE STRATEGY THAT
                            GOES BEYOND THE COMMERCIAL VIEWS OF INDIVIDUAL FIRMS.</p>
                        <p>14. THE GRAIN AGREEMENT IS A GOOD BUT NARROW EXAMPLE OF WHAT I AM TALKING
                            ABOUT. THE SOVIETS WERE FORCED TO ACCEPT THAT THEY NEED SUBSTANTIAL
                            IMPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES. THAT GIVES US LEVERAGE, BUT ONLY IF IT
                            IS DONE WITHIN A COHERENT FRAMEWORK OF POLICIES TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN
                            OBJECTIVES. <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> HAS</p>

                        <p>BEEN CONSIDERED A CONCESSION TO THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>, AND IN A SENSEE IT IS. THE SOVIETS DON'T LIKE PAYING
                            INTEREST -- THEY PREFER TO EARN THEIR WAY AS THEY GO. IF THIS IS AN
                            ACCURATE ASSESSMENT, THEN WITH <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> AND
                            CREDIT POLICIES WE CAN GET THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> TO
                            BE COMPETITIVELY ENGAGED IN OUR <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            MARKETS. IF DONE SKILLFULLY, THIS FORCES THEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS
                            OF THE SOPHISTICATED <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> MARKET. MFN ENTRY
                            INTO <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> MARKETS CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON
                            SOVIET BEHAVIOR. THIS IS NOT A TRIVIAL MATTER.</p>
                        <p>15. IT IS IN OUR LONG-TERM INTERESTS TO USE THESE STRENGTHS TO BREAK DOWN
                            THE AUTARKIC NATURE OF THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. THERE
                            ARE CONSUMER CHOICES BEING MADE IN THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> THAT, ALTHOUGH MORE BELOW THE SURFACE THAN THOSE IN
                            THE UNITED STATES, CAN BE EXPLOITED. THIS IS JUST ONE ILLUSTRATION.
                            THERE ARE MANY ASSETS IN THE WEST IN THIS AREA AND INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT
                            THEM AS JUST COMMERCIAL SALES, WE NEED TO BE USING THEM TO DRAW THE
                            SOVIET UNION INTO A SERIES OF DEPENDENCIES AND TIES WITH THE WEST. IT IS
                            A LONG-TERM PROJECT.</p>
                        <p>16. WHEN WE LOST THE <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> BATTLE WITH
                            CONGRESS, WE LOST OUR ABILITY TO IMPOSE A DEGREE OF DISCIPLINE ON THE
                            SOVIET UNION AS WE WERE ABLE TO DO IN THE CASE OF THE GRAIN DEAL. THIS
                            IS THE REAL TRAGEDY OF LOSING THAT TRADE ISSUE. IN THE LONG-TERM, WE
                            HAVE SUFFERED A SETBACK.</p>
                        <p>17. WITH REGARD TO EASTERN EUROPE, IT MUST BE IN OUR LONG-TERM INTEREST
                            TO INFLUENCE EVENTS IN THIS AREA -- BECAUSE OF THE PRESENT UNNATURAL
                            RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SOVIET UNION -- SO THAT THEY WILL NOT SOONER OR
                            LATER EXPLODE, CAUSING WW III. THIS INORGANIC, UNNATURAL RELATIONSHIP IS
                            A FAR GREATER DANGER TO WORLD PEACE THAN THE CONFLICT BETWEEN EAST AND
                            WEST. THERE IS ONE QUALIFICATION TO THIS STATEMENT. IF WESTERN EUROPE
                            BECOMES SO CONCERNED WITH ITS ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS THAT AN
                            IMBALANCE DEVELOPS, THEN PERHAPS THE DANGERS TO THE UNITED STATES'
                            INTERESTS WILL BE ENDANGERED BY THE SIMPLE CHANGE IN THE BALANCE OF
                            POWER.</p>
                        <p>18. SO, IT MUST BE OUR POLICY TO STRIVE FOR AN EVOLUTION</p>
                        <p>SECRET</p>
                        <p>PAGE 06 STATE 024976</p>
                        <p>THAT MAKES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE EASTERN EUROPEANS AND THE SOVIET
                            UNION AN ORGANIC ONE. ANY EXCESS OF ZEAL ON OUR PART IS BOUND TO PRODUCE
                            RESULTS THAT COULD REVERSE THE DESIRED PROCESS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME,
                            EVEN THOUGH THE PROCESS WOULD REMAIN INEVITABLE WITHIN THE NEXT 100
                            YEARS. BUT, OF COURSE, FOR <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> THAT IS TOO
                            LONG A TIME TO WAIT.</p>
                        <p>19. SO, OUR POLICY MUST BE A POLICY OF RESPONDING TO THE CLEARLY VISIBLE
                            ASPIRATIONS IN EASTERN EUROPE FOR A MORE AUTONOMOUS EXISTENCE WITHIN THE
                            CONTEXT OF A STRONG SOVIET GEOPOLITICAL INFLUENCE. THIS HAS WORKED IN
                            POLAND. THE POLES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME THEIR ROMANTIC POLITICAL
                            INCLINATIONS WHICH LED TO THEIR DISASTERS IN THE PAST. THEY HAVE BEEN
                            SKILLFUL IN DEVELOPING A POLICY THAT IS SATISFYING THEIR NEEDS FOR A
                            NATIONAL IDENTITY WITHOUT AROUSING SOVIET REACTIONS. IT IS A LONG
                            PROCESS.</p>
                        <p>20. A SIMILAR PROCESS IS NOW GOING ON IN HUNGARY. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KJ3">JANOS KADAR</persName>'S PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN
                            REMARKABLE IN FINDING WAYS WHICH ARE ACCEPTABLE TO THE SOVIET UNION
                            WHICH DEVELOP HUNGARIAN ROOTS AND THE NATURAL ASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE.
                            HE HAS CONDUCTED A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS IN THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC
                            AREAS. TO A LARGE DEGREE HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE SOVIETS
                            HAVE FOUR DIVISIONS IN HUNGARY AND, THEREFORE, HAVE NOT BEEN OVERLY
                            CONCERNED. HE HAS SKILLFULLY USED THEIR PRESENCE AS A SECURITY BLANKET
                            FOR THE SOVIETS, IN A WAY THAT HAS BEEN ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE DEVELOPMENT
                            OF HIS OWN COUNTRY.</p>
                        <p>21. THE ROMANIAN PICTURE IS DIFFERENT AS ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM THEIR
                            DIFFERENT HISTORY. THE ROMANIANS HAVE STRIVEN FOR AUTONOMY BUT THEY HAVE
                            BEEN LESS DARING AND INNOVATIVE IN THEIR DOMESTIC SYSTEMS. THEY REMAIN
                            AMONG THE MOST RIGID COUNTRIES IN THE INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF THEIR
                            SYSTEM.</p>
                        <p>22. WE SEEK TO INFLUENCE THE EMERGENCE OF THE SOVIET IMPERIAL POWER BY
                            MAKING THE BASE MORE NATURAL AND ORGANIC SO THAT IT WILL NOT REMAIN
                            FOUNDED IN SHEER POWER ALONE. BUT THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE OPEN TO <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> OTHER THAN THAT OF INFLUENCING THE WAY
                            SOVIET POWER IS USED.</p>

                        <p>23. FINALLY, ON YUGOSLAVIA. WE AND THE WESTERN EUROPEANS, INDEED THE
                            EASTERN EUROPEANS AS WELL, HAVE AN INTEREST WHICH BORDERS ON THE VITAL
                            FOR <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> IN CONTINUING THE INDEPENDENCE OF
                            YUGOSLAVIA FROM SOVIET DOMINATION. OF COURSE WE ACCEPT THAT YUGOSLAV
                            BEHAVIOR WILL CONTINUE TO BE, AS IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST, INFLUENCED AND
                            CONSTRAINED BY SOVIET POWER, BUT ANY SHIFT BACK BY YUGOSLAVIA INTO THE
                            SOVIET ORBIT WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR STRATEGIC SET-BACK FOR THE WEST. SO
                            WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN TITO DISAPPEARS, AND IT IS
                            WORRYING <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> A GOOD DEAL.</p>
                        <p>24. SO OUR BASIC POLICY CONTINUES TO BE THAT WHICH WE HAVE PURSUED SINCE
                            1948-49, KEEPING YUGOSLAVIA IN A POSITION OF SUBSTANTIAL INDEPENDENCE
                            FROM THE SOVIET UNION. NOW AT THE SAME TIME WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE
                            LESS OBNOXIOUS, AND WE SHOULD ALLOW THEM TO GET AWAY WITH VERY LITTLE.
                            WE SHOULD ESPECIALLY DISABUSE THEM OF ANY NOTION THAT OUR INTEREST IN
                            THEIR RELATIVE INDEPENDENCE IS GREATER THAN THEIR OWN AND, THEREFORE,
                            THEY HAVE A FREE RIDE. END SUMMARY.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: I'm not sure I understand the purpose of this meeting.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: It concerns our
                            current policy toward various Eastern European countries.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: When am I going to get a paper on Portugal?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: It came up last
                            night; it must be up here somewhere.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I haven't seen it yet. Do you have a paper on what to do
                            if the Communists win the election in Italy?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: No, I really haven't
                            yet. But I have one person working on it and we also have a NSM
                            exercise.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d16-02" facs="d16-02"/>
                        <p>The Secretary: The hell with the NSM exercise. I want to see what the
                            Department's views are. I want to do everything possible to make them
                            understand how they would cut themselves off from the rest of us. First
                            I'd like to see spelled out the various ways in which the Communists can
                            come to power.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: That looks less
                            and less likely now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: It looks clear that
                            if they can gain any strength at all then they will be able to be the
                            brokers in forming a new government.</p>
                        <p>On Eastern Europe, we are continuing to keep Romania and Poland out in
                            front in our relations, including visits, trade, and industrial
                            cooperation. There are more U.S. business people going there than to the
                            others, and in fact they are more welcome there. We have a problem now
                            with Romania since the trade agreement needs to be renewed, but their
                            recent record on emigration is quite bad. It almost looks like a
                            deliberate attempt on their part to sabotage our efforts with the
                            Congress. American Jewish groups are aware of the recent emigration
                            figures and they're not happy. And they've been talking to the Congress.
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHGJ1">Barnes</persName> has been in and
                            talked with <persName corresp="#p_MG4">Macovescu</persName> and we've
                            been talking with <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName> here, but
                            we still are left with a problem. I think in the end we will get it
                            through Congress but we may have to go into the waiting period.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: What do you mean by “the waiting period"?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: If Congress takes no
                            action during the month of June then the law provides for a 60-day
                            waiting period. Isn't that correct?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AJA1">Armitage</persName>: Yes. The legislative
                            papers must go to the Congress by June 3. If there is no action in June,
                            then there is the additional 60-day waiting period.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: Congressman Green is
                            the fellow up there who has been very helpful to us on this problem in
                            the Past, but now it is hard for him to devote much time to it because
                            he is running for the Senate in Pennsylvania.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d16-03" facs="d16-03"/>
                        <p>The Secretary: The Congress won't have the nerve to cut it out. Haven't
                            you noticed that no pro-Jewish candidate has won this year?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: I hadn't made that
                            correlation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Being pro-Jewish emigration hasn't helped <persName
                                corresp="#p_JHM1">Jackson</persName> at all. It really seems that to
                            be a successful candidate this year you need to be anti-Jewish,
                            anti-black and anti-foreigner.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: And
                            anti-Washington.</p>
                        <p>Coming back to the substance, we wanted to review with you the question
                            of timing for taking some steps with certain Eastern European
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: Yes, there's a
                            rather old <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> -- <gloss
                                target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> 212 -- which sets up a sort of
                            pecking order for dealing with the Eastern European countries. In the
                            meantime, since <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> 212 was drawn up,
                            issues have moved on with the Czechs, East Germany, Hungary and
                            Bulgaria. They have responded in different ways, although the East
                            Germans are clearly still at the end of the line. Now we need to look at
                            how we respond to them. It seems on the one hand that it would be absurd
                            to be accused of advocating Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and then
                            not respond when Eastern European countries show movement. Yet it might
                            mean we'd be rewarding first the countries which have deviated least
                            from the Soviet line.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: The question here
                            really arises now only with regard to conclusion of science and cultural
                            cooperation agreements.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: Yes, it so
                            happens that Bulgaria is ready to sign with us before anyone else. In
                            theory, it should be Hungary that we sign with first since they are more
                            advanced in their diversity. It's really a shame in a way.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Why is it a shame? Why do we have to do it that way? How
                            did we arrive at this situation?</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d16-04" facs="d16-04"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: Well, the
                            Embassies and the desk officers and the rest of the machinery has taken
                            hold and been pushing along on these negotiations and this is the
                            result.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We can control the desk officers. They're right here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: But in fact the
                            situation results from the way in which the Eastern Europeans --
                                <persName corresp="#p_KJ3">Kadar</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_ZT1">Zhivkov</persName> and the others -- have responded
                            to our drafts. We gave them all draft texts of agreements and, in
                            reacting, they have moved at differing speeds.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: But we don't have to submit to this if we prefer not. Why
                            did we start all the negotiations at the same time?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: At Helsinki we told
                            each of the three countries that we would be starting negotiation of
                            science and technology agreements. They have simply responded in
                            different ways.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: We could have given them the texts at different times. Why
                            did we promise them all at the same time that we would give them the
                            texts?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: We were looking for
                            something to tell their Foreign Ministers at Helsinki.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: That's the problem with including things in my briefing
                            papers among the options. One bureau here recently slipped in a new
                            option among an entire range of options including such things as flying
                            to the moon and having a Chiefs of State Summit with Kosygin. I can tell
                            you it wasn't <gloss target="#t_EUR1">EUR</gloss>. But they did slip in
                            an option like that.</p>
                        <p>On this question, anyone should have known that I wanted to have
                            differential treatment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ANG1">Andrews</persName>: Mr. Secretary, I
                            should point out that we have had before us a long time the question of
                            negotiating such cooperation agreements with Czechoslovakia <pb n="5"
                                xml:id="d16-05" facs="d16-05"/>and Hungary. We first exchanged
                            drafts with Czechoslovakia and Hungary long before the Trade Act was
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: All right, then what is the issue here?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: The issue is how
                            to respond to the countries when they are ready to sign with us, and
                            whether we shouldn't revise <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> 212 to
                            take this into account. Also, there is another point in that Commerce
                            wants to move ahead more quickly for trade reasons. That issue is more
                            or less finessed here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: You don't really have
                            a trade issue here.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I'd like to keep the pecking order even if we violate it
                            for this purpose. I don't want to revise the <gloss target="#t_NSDM1"

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: If we don't go
                            the route of revising the <gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss>, why
                            don't we have <persName corresp="#p_SB3">Scowcroft</persName> do a memo
                            spelling out that we can sign these agreements as they come? That would
                            be an alternative.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Yes, that would be preferable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: Let me then take up

                            1). In this connection, we would like to review the Department of State

                                >RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> relationship.</p>
                        <p>The Legislative Mandate</p>
                        <p>The Board for International Broadcasting Act of 1973 established the
                                <gloss target="#t_BIB1">BIB</gloss> as a presidentially appointed
                            body with authority, inter alia, to grant funds to the Radios, to review
                            and evaluate the Radios' mission and operation, and to “assess the
                            quality, effectiveness, and professional integrity of their broadcasting
                            within the context of the broad foreign policy objectives of the United
                            States”. The Act declared the <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>/<gloss
                                target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> to be in the national interest and
                            “independent broadcast media, operating in a manner not inconsistent
                            with the broad foreign policy objectives of the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and in accordance with high professional standards”.</p>

                        <p>The Act restricted the role of the Secretary Of State to providing “the
                            Board with such information regarding the foreign policy of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as the Secretary shall deem
                            necessary”.</p>
                        <p>Congress intentionally followed the recommendations of the Eisenhower
                            Commission in seeking to insulate the Radios from the Department of
                            State and to prescribe <gloss target="#t_BIB1">BIB</gloss> authority
                            over <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1"

                        <p>The criteria for determining whether the Radios are acting in a manner
                            “not inconsistent with” <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy are set
                            out in <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>'s internal guidelines. These
                            guidelines, prepared by the Radios in consultation with <gloss
                                target="#t_BIB1">BIB</gloss> and State, call for objectivity,
                            relevance and timeliness of broadcasts, and list a multitude of
                            restraints, such as avoidance of vituperation, belligerency,
                            emotionalism, sweeping generalization, and incitement.</p>
                        <p>State's Role</p>
                        <p>We have attempted to carry out the task of providing foreign policy
                            guidance through continued liaison, correspondence and briefings, both
                            here and in Munich, with <gloss target="#t_BIB1">BIB</gloss> and <gloss

                            officials. Informally, we have attempted to guide the Radios away from
                            some of their excesses and towards more effective broadcasting. This has

                        <p>Perhaps our best channel of communication regarding programming is
                            between the Political Officer at our Consulate General and <gloss

                            allows for urgent consultation and timely guidance suggestions to the
                            Radios, but in touchy situations requires that we inform and obtain
                            concurrence from <gloss target="#t_BIB1">BIB</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> in Washington. Our man in Munich also
                            maintains contact with researchers and broadcasters throughout the
                            Radios and is an extremely useful source for us of the Radios' internal
                            problems and policies.</p>
                        <p>The Polish Case</p>
                        <p>The recent case of <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> treatment of the
                            Polish price rises is illustrative of both our efforts to and problems
                            with influencing the radio's output, even on an issue as potentially
                            disruptive as the price increase. Especially so, as the journalistic
                            talent, the almost defiant independence and the political connections of
                            the Polish broadcasting desk have made it the center of differences
                            between State and <gloss target="#t_BIB1">BIB</gloss> on one hand and
                                <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1"
                                >RL</gloss> on the other over <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>
                            programming.</p>
                        <p>After Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_OS4">Olszowski</persName>
                            briefed Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DRT1">Davies</persName> on the
                            upcoming price rises and specifically asked that we use our influence to
                            get <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>
                            <pb n="4" xml:id="d17-04" facs="d17-04"/>to treat them accurately and
                            responsibly, <persName corresp="#p_DRT1">Davies</persName> made some
                            specific recommendations and suggestions regarding <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> handling of the issue. We immediately
                            alerted <gloss target="#t_BIB1">BIB</gloss> (Roberts) to the problem and
                            he obtained <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1"
                                >RL</gloss> (Mickelson) concurrence that the issue should be handled
                            responsibly and that we could make suggestions regarding its treatment
                            in Munich. Hemsing (a former <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                            officer, appointed <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> Program Director
                            last year) assumed direct responsibility for the Polish treatment and we
                            relayed to him through Consulate Munich suggestions regarding handling
                            of the issue. However, the analyses and commentary are prepared in
                            Polish and Hemsing has not been able to establish a position which would
                            allow him to screen and approve commentary in advance. Hence, although
                            in close touch with us, he gave daily instructions, reviewed scripts
                            post facto and, we understand, subsequently reprimanded the Polish
                            service for some scripts, <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>
                            complained to Davies on July 4 that the Poles had found some <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss> broadcasts objectionable and our review
                            of the scripts later revealed some grounds for legitimate complaint by
                            the Poles.</p>
                        <p>We went over these scripts with <gloss target="#t_BIB1">BIB</gloss>
                            (ROBERTS) and <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1"
                                >RL</gloss> (Mickelson) and they acknowledged that while most
                            scripts were satisfactory, some of them were overly emotional, seemingly
                            unrelated to the facts and given to sweeping and unbalanced
                            generalizations. They agreed that there was some violation of <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>'s own internal guidelines and undertook
                            to take appropriate action to correct the problem. However, Mickelson
                            held firm to his insistence that the Radios were “independent” and would
                            exercise final discretion in what should be carried on the Radios.</p>

                                >RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> Relationship</p>
                        <p>The basic problem stems from the fact that much of the Radios'
                            programming personnel are emigres from the fifties, steeped in undiluted
                            and rather <pb n="5" xml:id="d17-05" facs="d17-05"/>indiscriminate
                            emigre-oriented hostility to the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe,
                            convinced that the Radios' effectiveness stems from its ability to
                            freewheel “independently” and operate outside State's direct guidance.
                            The problem is most acute on the Polish and, to a lesser extent, the
                            Romanian desks. Personnel on the Polish desk have close communication
                            with Polish-American circles and are aware that Congressional and other
                            public circles would be responsive to any appeals that they were being
                            “muzzled” by State censors (you will recall the letters from
                            Brzesinski-Griffith-Pipes; there was also a recent one from Aloysuis
                            Mazewski, head of the Polish American Congress).</p>

                            and we were agreed that the key to establishing effective guidance and
                            programming of the Radios lay in replacing the directing radio officials

                            chose to head the operation has little sense of or feel for the

                            believe the present oversight and funding instrument - the Board - needs
                            to be replaced by a direct governmental instrumentality.” (Letter at Tab

                            with Mickelson which might be treated by the media and some of his

                            that might be taken to improve the effectiveness of <gloss

                            countries. In order to comply with the requirements of the Act, a number
                            of important issues must be addressed, including the advisability of
                            facility-sharing by Voice of America (<gloss target="#t_VOA1"

                        <p>DATE AND TIME: Monday, October 11, 1976 10:08 - 10:35 a.m.</p>
                        <p>PLACE: The Oval Office</p>
                        <p>The President: Are you going to resign because your President let you
                            down?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Don't even think of
                            what happened. One little glitch.</p>
                        <p>The President: I thought I did well except for that one slip.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You have confirmed in
                            that debate the country's need for you and the disaster that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJE3">Carter</persName> would be.</p>
                        <p>The one thing you didn't get a chance to do is conceptualize. Almost all
                            the newsmen feel the same way.</p>
                        <p>What <persName corresp="#p_CJE3">Carter</persName> said makes you really
                            frightened. I really cracked the press group on it Friday night.</p>
                        <p>The President: Teeter says the first reports after the debate put us 14
                            percent ahead. It was after two days of press play on Eastern Europe
                            that it turned around.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: For the future, I
                            think what you should do is conceptualize.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d20-02" facs="d20-02"/>
                        <p>The President: I wanted to show up his defense policy and the “morality”
                            argument.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would say on the
                            last point you're playing his game. I would hit him hard. Saying he is
                            denigrating America with his talk. It can still be done. I don't know
                            anyone who likes <persName corresp="#p_CJE3">Carter</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President: I will get some Eastern European ethnics in to say I made
                            a mistake but they know what I stand for.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree, and say they
                            shouldn't let <persName corresp="#p_CJE3">Carter</persName> use it to
                            demagogue and make cheap shots.</p>

                                <item>-- What are U.S. economic interests in Eastern Europe and the
                                    Soviet Union? How have they evolved over the last ten years and
                                    what is the projection over the next ten years? Are all
                                    opportunities being exploited in pursuit of those interests, and
                                    if not, what are the constraints? What problems, with Eastern
                                    European countries, and with our allies, could arise in pursuing
                                    these opportunities?</item>
                                <item>-- What are the economic interests of the Soviet Union and
                                    Eastern Europe in the U. S. and the West? How important are they
                                    in relation to the national objectives of these countries? What
                                    problems or constraints -- internal, with their allies, and with
                                    the West -- do they have in pursuing their economic
                                    interest?</item>
                                <pb n="2" xml:id="d21-02" facs="d21-02"/>
                                <item>-- What are the major impediments to more normal economic
                                    relations between market and non-market economies? What
                                    constitutes effective economic reciprocity in East-West economic
                                    relations? What measures should the U.S. take with other
                                    industrialized democracies, in multilateral forums and
                                    bilaterally with non-market economies, to help ensure effective
                                    reciprocity and to deal with the problem of disruption or unfair
                                    trade practices resulting from trade with non-market economy
                                    countries?</item>
                                <item>-- How, and to what degree, could economic relations between
                                    the industrialized Western nations and Eastern nations be used
                                    to pursue non-economic policy interests in the short and
                                    long-term future, and at what costs to our own economic
                                    interests? What would be the principal instruments of economic
                                    leverage? To what degree and under what circumstances might they
                                    be most effective and which non-economic interests are
                                    appropriate and susceptible to such economic leverage? How, and
                                    to what degree, could the U.S. exert effective leverage in the
                                    absence of a common approach by the major industrialized
                                    democracies, and at what costs to our economic and other
                                    interests?</item>
                                <item>-- How, and to what degree, could the Eastern Europeans and
                                    the Soviet Union collectively or separately use economic
                                    relations with the industrialized nations to achieve economic or
                                    non-economic objectives inimical to the interests of the U. S.
                                    and the West? What actions might we take unilaterally or in
                                    cooperation with the other industrial democracies to inhibit the
                                    use of such economic leverage?</item>
                                <item>-- In formulating our economic policies, to what extent is it
                                    desirable to distinguish among the countries of Eastern Europe
                                    and the Soviet Union? What measures could be taken by the U. S.,
                                    and the industrialized democracies as a whole, to use to our
                                    advantage the diversity of interests and needs among Eastern
                                    countries?</item>
                                <item>-- What are the costs and benefits of attempting to bring the
                                    Soviet Union and Eastern European countries into the process of
                                    assisting development in the Third World or more active
                                    involvement in other economic issues? What policy measures could
                                    or should be taken to encourage this type of Eastern involvement
                                    in the global economy?</item>

                        <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT</p>
                        <p>The United States international broadcasting effort is a key element of
                            our foreign policy. Making known our policies and our ideals to the
                            peoples of the world is of vital importance to the furtherance of US
                            interests and objectives. Our most critical audiences for international
                            broadcasting are in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, where
                            censorship and controlled media provide the peoples of the area with
                            distorted images of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy, and events within their own
                            countries and the world at large.</p>
                        <p>There are two distinct <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> international
                            broadcasters to this area -- The Voice of America (<gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty
                                (<gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1"
                                >RL</gloss>). The <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> is an integral
                            part of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government and its primary
                            function is to present world news, to give expression to <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> official policy and to articulate
                            American values and opinions. <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>/<gloss

                            “independent broadcast media, operating in a manner not inconsistent
                            with broad foreign policy objectives…” Their primary task is to
                            encourage a constructive dialogue with the peoples of the <gloss

                            and Eastern Europe (<gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>). Broadcast
                            content is focused on the interest of the local audiences. <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> broadcasts are generally, if
                            reluctantly, accepted by the Soviet and East European regimes as an

                            Radios' basic approaches and funding, as “cold-war relics”, dedicated to
                            subversion rather than the freer flow of information.</p>
                        <p>In the FY 1977 Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Congress asked that
                            the President submit a report on the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>

                                interest does not preclude consideration of reduction of duplication

                            <item>-- Even a cursory examination of the advisability of extending

                                additional countries where access to information is restricted
                                suggests that there are immense difficulties in such a project. This
                                question arose in Congress with regard to <gloss target="#t_RFE1"
                                    >RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> operations and

                                />geographical expansion of the Radios' transmissions. Except for
                                Western Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and a very few
                                other countries, virtually all the remaining governments of the
                                world restrict the access of their citizens to information by
                                controlling the local press and/or by controlling and censoring
                                international media coming into the country. Such restrictions would
                                have to be judged as severe at least some of the time in several
                                dozen countries in the Middle East, the Far East, Africa and Latin
                                America. Political conditions, moreover, in many if not most of
                                these countries can change markedly, resulting in a further
                                tightening, or loosening, of restrictions. Thus, the list of
                                “restricted” countries would be constantly shifting.</item>

                            effort carried out by <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> goes a long
                            way towards meeting our needs. <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>
                            presently broadcasts in 36 languages to diverse parts of the world for a

                            English Service is worldwide and averages 164 hours weekly. Among the

                            French to Africa 37 hours, and Arabic 49 hours weekly. At times, unusual
                            political circumstances arise in a single country which call for
                            increased <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> activity. For example, the

                            revolution led USIA to introduce a <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>
                            service in Portuguese to Portugal since <gloss target="#t_US1"

                                the eventual construction of ten additional transmitters in the

                            <item>-- The current crowding of the shortwave broadcasting band
                                continues to reduce the quality of the signals on the available
                                frequencies. There will be a World Administrative Radio Conference
                                in 1979 to address the question of expanding the shortwave broadcast
                                band.</item>
                            <item>-- With the assistance of a recognized technical expert fourteen
                                separate options were examined, including several which would assume
                                integrated programming by the two radios. Four of these are assessed
                                below and later in this memorandum. It should be stressed that all
                                four accept the premise that, whatever the decision on the program
                                schedules, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> should transmit
                                signals which meet minimum requirements for technical
                                effectiveness.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p rend="flushleft">
                            <hi rend="italic">Options</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. Option one would retain current program scheduling of <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RFE1"
                                >RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> broadcasts to the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Eastern Europe and add
                            seven transmitters to meet the minimum technical requirement (62 100 to
                            250 KW transmitters) for effective signals if no allowance is made for
                            jamming.</p>
                        <p>This option essentially would take the step considered necessary by
                            competent experts to provide the current radio operations the minimal
                            technical strength to pursue their missions as currently defined,
                            thereby remedying a long-standing inadequacy. It would avoid the risks
                            (possible resumption of <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> jamming
                            and/or Soviet and <pb n="6" xml:id="d23-06" facs="d23-06"/>East European

                            would reaffirm the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> commitment to a
                            freer flow of information in the face of the sharp Soviet/East European
                            attacks on <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1"
                                >RL</gloss>. It should command Congressional support.</p>
                        <p>This option would make no provision for an enhanced <gloss
                                target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss>
                            capacity to penetrate jamming or for meeting the contingency of loss of
                                <gloss target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss>'s transmitter site in Spain (still
                            a possibility) or resumption of jamming of <gloss target="#t_VOA1"
                                >VOA</gloss> (a less likely development). Nor would it provide new
                            transmitters for a reserve or strengthening capacity. At the same time,
                            it would cost about $14 million and thus forego the economies possible
                            under the third and fourth options.</p>
                        <p>2. Option two would retain current program scheduling and add sixteen
                            transmitters, the seven of option one for current technical requirements
                            plus nine to boost <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>/<gloss
                                target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss>'s capacity to counteract jamming, to
                            serve in a reserve capacity, and to upgrade and strengthen existing
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>This option would cost about $32 million. It could not completely
                            overcome jamming, but the deployment of additional transmitters to
                            counteract jamming is a feasible, realistic and necessary strategy to
                            increase the level and reliability of <gloss target="#t_RFE1"
                                >RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> reception in the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, Poland, Czechoslovakia and
                            Bulgaria. The study established the minimum number of transmitters
                            required for broadcasting in an unjammed environment, and found that the
                            requirements for <gloss target="#t_RFE1">RFE</gloss>/<gloss
                                target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> broadcasting to jammed environments
                            should be in excess of the requirements for an unjammed environment.
                            While the number of additional transmitters to be deployed for this
                            purpose is a matter of judgment, the study suggested a modest but
                            significant increase of one additional transmitter for each of the nine
                            sets of three transmitters for language broadcasts now being jammed -- a
                            total of nine additional transmitters. The Office of Management and
                            Budget does not believe the addition of transmitters would overcome
                            jamming, especially if the Soviet Union and the East Europeans step up
                            their jamming in response.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d23-07" facs="d23-07"/>
                        <p>This option would also reaffirm in strong terms our commitment to the
                            freer flow of information. It would provide transmitters which could
                            serve in reserve capacity in case of breakdown of existing facilities,
                            and which could serve to upgrade and strengthen existing older and
                            underpowered facilities. It avoids blurring the Radios' identities, but
                            it would forego the economies of options three and four. (It would,
                            however, be possible to make the reductions in language transmissions
                            foreseen in Options three and four, but add transmitters to combat
                            jamming in the remaining broadcasts.)</p>
                        <p>A variant of this option would add six more new transmitters (cost $12
                            million) to provide additional capacity against the contingency of
                            resumed jamming of <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> or loss of
                            transmitter sites, but the Committee does not deem these contingencies
                            sufficiently urgent to justify the additional expenditure at this
                            time.</p>
                        <p>3. Option three would eliminate <gloss target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss>
                            broadcasts in the native languages to indigenous Soviet nationalities
                            Belorussia, the Caucasus and Central Asia and integrate <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RFE1"

                            schedules for the Eastern European countries, the Ukraine and the Baltic
                            states (Full and separate <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> Russian broadcasts would remain).</p>
                        <p>From the point of view of effecting economies through program alteration
                            this option is the most feasible of the numerous options examined. Its
                            advantages and disadvantages are substantial and it has received the
                            most careful consideration.</p>
                        <p>This option would effect a saving of nine transmitters ($14 million for
                            new facilities) from the 62 required for minimum technical transmitter
                            requirements (option 1) and about $2.5 million in annual operating
                            costs. Full <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> programming in Russian would be
                            maintained as would <gloss target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> native language transmissions to <pb

                                >VOA</gloss> native language transmissions to the Caucasus and
                            Central Asia (Uzbek only). No “original” programming in prime time hours
                            by <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> or <gloss target="#t_RFE1"
                                >RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> would be sacrificed
                            in the integrated program languages (East European languages, Baltic
                            languages and Ukrainian). Fifteen hours of simultaneous broadcasting by
                                <gloss target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_RFE1"
                                >RFE</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> would be eliminated.
                            RL languages eliminated (Belorussian, Georgian, Armenian and the Moslem
                            languages) may be currently among the least effective of <gloss
                                target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss>'s nationality broadcasts.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the integration of program scheduling would blur the
                            distinction between the radios and thereby afford additional opportunity
                            to the Soviet Union and the East Europeans to step up attacks on <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss>, to resume the jamming of <gloss
                                target="#t_VOA1">VOA</gloss> and/or to inhibit other <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> information and cultural activities. This
                            risk is difficult to evaluate but has been judged substantial by the
                            previous <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Ambassador to the Soviet
                            Union, <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Walter Stoessel</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The substantial reduction in prime time transmission to the Ukraine and
                            the Baltic states (over 50%) and Eastern Europe (about 25%) and the
                            replacement of at least 3-1/2 hours daily of unjammed <gloss

                            broadcasts would occasion an appreciable decline in listenership.
                            Coupled with the elimination of the only Western broadcasts to eight
                            Moslem nationalities, these changes could well be interpreted by our
                            public, some sectors of Congress, some allies and the <gloss

                            broadcasters. In particular, key Congressional supporters would probably
                            not find acceptable the reduced transmission to Poland, the Ukraine and
                            the Baltic states. Lastly, no provision would be made to improve the

                                >RL</gloss>'s capacity to overcome jamming, to meet the contingency
                            of the loss of the Spanish transmitter site, or to provide reserve or

                        <p>On balance, the Committee believes that the disadvantages of this option
                            outweigh its benefits.</p>
                        <p>4. Option four would eliminate <gloss target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss>

                            Belorussia, the Caucasus and Central Asia without any sharing of <gloss

                            broadcasts to the Caucasus and Central Asia (Uzbek only). Currently, the

                                target="#t_RL1">RL</gloss> facilities would be avoided.</p>
                        <p>The option would eliminate the only Western native language broadcasts to

                        <p>The economic benefits the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> seeks in
                            trading with the East are the same as those it expects from foreign
                            trade generally. These include foreign markets for <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> goods, with positive effects on the

                            efficiently produced abroad. Although <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            trade with the East is small compared with total <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> foreign trade, our trade surplus has been large ($4.5
                            billion in 1971-75), and has helped substantially to offset deficits in
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> trade with the rest of the world
                            in recent years. Eastern markets are becoming increasingly important to
                            the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> agricultural sector, and
                            agricultural exports are essential to a domestic farm policy that
                            promotes full production. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            non-agricultural exports to the East remain modest, however, as do
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> imports of Eastern goods and
                            services. The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economy is not dependent
                            on East-West trade.</p>

                            in relation to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> national objectives?

                        <p>The advancement of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic interests
                            in the East generally supports the achievement of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> national objectives. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            trade with the East, like other trade, strengthens the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economy, thereby strengthening the
                            country generally. The establishment of good trade and economic
                            relations with the East provides incentives for the Communist countries
                            to move away from their historical emphasis on self-sufficiency, toward
                            a pattern of sustained economic interaction with the United States and
                            the West. This pattern does not of course preclude the possibility of
                            war, but it does make it necessary for Soviet policymakers to consider
                            the potential costs in economic terms of indulging in aggressive or
                            expansionist foreign adventures. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> trade
                            with the East is also a response to Eastern initiatives, the rejection
                            of which could have a negative impact on East-West political relations.
                            The development of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> trade with Eastern
                            Europe helps to reduce these countries' economic dependence on the

                            Congress took note of the favorable impact of East-West trade on
                            achievement of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> national objectives by

                        <p>As <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> trade with the East has expanded,
                            the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has acquired a greater interest in
                            the establishment of a stable, long-term trading relationship. This is
                            especially true in the agricultural sector, where grain sales to the
                            East have become an important feature in world trade. In
                            non-agricultural trade, a number of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            companies have established long-term relationships with Eastern

                            production is specifically geared to the Eastern market. Imports from
                            the East, which have increased more slowly than exports, are less
                            important to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economy. East-West
                            trade is only a small percentage of world trade, and the <gloss

                            expected to continue at a high level, perhaps increasing over their

                        <p>e. Are all opportunities being exploited in pursuit of these interests,
                            and if not, what are the constraints? (see pp. 45, 60-72, 86-110)</p>
                        <p>The primary constraint on the continued rapid expansion of East-West
                            trade is financial. East-West trade is conducted in convertible
                            currencies (chiefly dollars), which the Eastern countries must acquire
                            through exports of goods and services to the West or through borrowing.
                            (For the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, gold sales are also
                            important.) Eastern manufactured goods do not readily find buyers in the
                            West, and Eastern exports of raw materials are limited by production <pb

                            demand. Earnings from invisibles, such as tourism and shipping, have not
                            been sufficient to cover the Eastern deficits in merchandise trade.
                            Eastern indebtedness to the West has risen sharply since 1974. Western
                            exporters and financial institutions will not indefinitely extend credit
                            to finance Eastern current-account deficits. For some Eastern countries,
                            the need to service the debt is already a constraint on import capacity,
                            and future borrowing is likely to be more restrained.</p>

                        <p>Chronic Eastern hard-currency trade deficits have resulted in a large
                            accumulation of external debt. Western countries should be cautious in
                            their lending policies (and Eastern countries can be expected to show
                            restraint in borrowing) so that the growth of the Communist-country debt
                            (although it is not now unmanageable) does not in the future jeopardize
                            the market's willingness to make credit available for the expansion of
                            East-West trade. A precipitous drop in East-West trade could threaten
                            disruption of the plans for economic growth in some Eastern European
                            countries, and that in turn could contribute to political instability in

                                <p>In trading with the West, the East is interested in the usual
                                    benefits of foreign trade and in expediting industrialization
                                    and modernization. The Eastern countries seek especially to
                                    acquire advanced Western technology and equipment. The Soviet
                                    Union, Poland, and the German Democratic Republic also import
                                    large amounts of grain from the West, largely in response to
                                    consumer demand for improved diets. Soviet imports of

                            between market and nonmarket economies? (see pp. 507, 50-53, 106-108,
                            114-122)</p>
                        <p>Political and security considerations and systemic economic differences
                            severely complicate East-West trade relations.</p>
                        <pb n="14" xml:id="d24-14" facs="d24-14"/>
                        <p>Eastern economies are centrally planned, and foreign trade operates
                            through state-controlled monopolies. The domestic price structures of
                            the Eastern countries are isolated, to varying degrees, from the
                            influence of world-market prices. Eastern tariffs, because they do not
                            affect domestic prices, are generally ineffective as regulators of
                            trade, and non-tariff measures can be carried forward in secrecy. The
                            negotiation of reciprocal trade concessions between East and West is
                            therefore extremely difficult. Because the prices of the factors of
                            production in the East need not reflect market forces, Western countries
                            find it awkward to administer trade laws based on market concepts, such
                            as those on dumping or subsidization, with regard to Eastern goods. Some
                            Western countries have found it necessary to resort to discriminatory
                            protective devices.</p>
                        <p>In addition, Eastern industries, because they face no competition at
                            home, are generally ill-equipped to compete on international markets.
                            Eastern exporters are deficient in marketing skills. Because of Eastern
                            state-trading monopolies, the lack of public economic information, and
                            the difficulty of dealing directly with end-users, Western firms must
                            develop new marketing techniques if they wish to export to the East.</p>

                        <p>The political division of Europe has severely inhibited the growth of
                            East-West economic relations. Political and security considerations have
                            especially influenced <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> trade and
                            economic relations with the East, but they have also influenced the
                            East-West trade policies of other Western countries. Security concerns
                            have produced a Western embargo, in which <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                        <p>Prices in individual East-West trade transactions measure economic
                            reciprocity from the standpoint of the traders, just as they do in trade
                            between market-economy countries. In the long run, roughly balanced
                            trade between East and West (though not between individual countries) is
                            necessary for effective economic reciprocity, because there are no
                            substantial offsets to Eastern trade deficits except credit, which the
                            West will of course not permit to rise indefinitely.</p>

                            with nonmarket economies, to help ensure effective reciprocity and to
                            deal with the problem of disruption or unfair trade practices resulting
                            from trade with nonmarket-economy countries? (see pp. 114-120)</p>
                        <p>To help ensure effective reciprocity, the West should avoid extending
                            credit on especially liberal terms, particularly to those Eastern
                            countries with chronic major trade deficits with hard-currency
                            areas.</p>

                            Following conclusion of the MTN, attention should be given to

                        </p>
                        <p>a. How, and to what degree, could economic relations between the
                            industrialized Western nations and Eastern nations be used to pursue
                            non-economic policy interests in the short and long-term future, and at
                            what costs to our own economic interests? (see pp. 123-150)</p>
                        <p>Economic relations could be used either as positive or negative leverage
                            to pursue non-economic policy interests. Positive leverage could take
                            the form of permitting transactions we had previously denied, if our
                            non-economic conditions were met. This would result in benefits rather
                            than costs to our economic interests. Positive leverage in the form of
                            removal of political conditions, such as the link between emigration and
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> and credits, would not entail
                            economic costs to the U.S. and could result in economic benefits.
                            Positive leverage in the form of liberalizing economic conditions, such
                            as availability of Government-backed credits, could reduce the immediate
                            balance-of-payments benefit to us of the affected trade, but this cost
                            might be reduced or eliminated if the liberalization stimulated an
                            increase in trade resulting in the employment of idle resources.</p>
                        <p>Negative leverage could take the form of partial or total denial of
                            trade. The cost of trade denial would be loss of export earnings and of
                            related jobs in the West. There would also be the risk that the East
                            would retaliate by denying Western access to such Eastern items as oil
                                <pb n="18" xml:id="d24-18" facs="d24-18"/>and gas, chrome and
                            platinum, by defaulting on financial obligations, or by taking steps
                            adverse to our interests outside the economic sphere. Another cost of a
                            partial trade denial would be the inequity of placing the burden of
                            economic leverage on only some sectors(s) of the Western economy.
                            Short-term measures would be constrained by existing legislation;
                            long-term measures could be more sweeping.</p>
                        <p>b. What would be the principal instruments of economic leverage? (see pp.
                            128-150)</p>
                        <p>The principal instruments of economic leverage are those economic goods
                            and benefits the East seeks and the West can make available or withhold:
                            technology and advanced industrial goods, grain, credits, and access to
                            Western markets for Eastern exporters. Domestic laws international
                            agreements and understandings limit the discretionary authority of
                            Western Governments to extend or withhold these benefits. In addition,
                            the power of decision in most of these areas lies more with the private
                            sector than with the Government, although private-sector decisions can
                            be influenced by public policy and attitudes.</p>
                        <p>c. To what degree and under what circumstances might they be most
                            effective and which non- economic interests are appropriate and
                            susceptible to such economic leverage? (see pp. 80-81, 124-130, 136,
                            143-144</p>
                        <pb n="19" xml:id="d24-19" facs="d24-19"/>
                        <p>Evidence on the effectiveness of past efforts to use economic leverage is
                            largely inconclusive. The intended non-economic effects of politicized
                            economic decisions have often not been clearly stated. In those cases
                            where non-economic conditions have been clearly stated, other factors
                            have also had an effect on the targeted non-economic issue. The clearest
                            case of attempted leverage is U.S. conditioning of most-favored-nation
                            tariff treatment and government-backed credits on freer emigration from
                            the East. The increase in Jewish emigration from the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> in 1973 appears to have been partly
                            the result of U.S. diplomatic approaches along these lines in 1972-73.
                            The later decline in emigration appears to have been largely the result
                            of Soviet refusal to appear to be bowing to pressure from the U.S.,
                            which made the trade-emigration link a matter of law in January, 1975. A
                            1975 embargo on grain shipments to the Soviet Union, which was primarily
                            economically motivated, was short-lived because of vigorous <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> farm-community opposition. A 1968 Public
                            Law denying ExIm credits to countries trading with North Vietnam was not
                            followed by any Communist country cutting off such trade. This history
                            suggests that quiet diplomacy is more effective than public
                            confrontation, that selection of an economic lever considered vital to
                            an influential segment of the U.S. population is not viable, and that
                            economic leverage is more likely to be <pb n="20" xml:id="d24-20"
                                facs="d24-20"/>effective if the non-economic objective is
                            appropriate to the amount of leverage available.</p>
                        <p>d. How, and to what degree, could the U.S. exert effective leverage in
                            the absence of a common approach by the major industrialized
                            democracies, and at what costs to our economic and other interests? (see
                            pp. 5-12, 50-51, 68-70, 136-137, 141)</p>
                        <p>Our allies have made it clear that they do not wish to participate in a
                            common approach to use East-West trade in non-strategic items for
                            political purposes. Positive leverage and, within the area of negative
                            leverage, the threat of denial of items uniquely available in the U.S.,
                            would be reasonable U.S. options in the absence of a multilateral
                            Western approach. These options would be less effective than the threat
                            of denial of a wider range of Western goods and technologies, although
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is to some extent dependent
                            upon the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as a source for feed grains
                            in years of poor Soviet harvests and the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> recognizes the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> as
                            the leading nation in many technologies. Existing legislation and
                            international agreements constrain the use of this negative leverage,
                            however.</p>
                        <p>The most fruitful approach for unilateral <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> leverage would probably be removal of existing
                            unfavorable discrimination and permitting previously denied
                            transactions. Our <pb n="21" xml:id="d24-21" facs="d24-21"/>economic
                            interests would be disproportionately sacrificed if we exerted other
                            forms of leverage unilaterally. Positive leverage in the form of
                            favorable discrimination would expose primarily the U.S. to pressure
                            from others for comparable favors. Denying items uniquely available in
                            the U.S. would affect precisely those areas where the U.S. has a
                            competitive advantage and would turn Eastern customers to other Western
                            sources for related (and perhaps unrelated) non-unique items previously
                            procured from the U.S. but procurable outside the U.S. with a longer
                            lead time. There would also be an adverse impact on Western cooperation
                            generally in non-economic as well as economic aspects of East-West
                            relations.</p>

                            one country to another. Their possibilities are limited, because Eastern
                            economic relations with the West (excluding Finland) have at most only a
                            marginal effect on the functioning and well-being of Western economies.
                            It is unlikely that any Western country would make a significant
                            concession to the East on a noneconomic matter of vital interest as a
                            reaction to Eastern economic leverage. It is virtually inconceivable
                            that the U.S. would.</p>
                        <p>b. What actions might we take unilaterally or in cooperation with the
                            other industrial democracies to inhibit the use of such economic
                            leverage? (see pp. 1-3, 151-153, 156-158)</p>
                        <p>The West should avoid becoming dependent on Eastern sources for materials
                            and products in order to inhibit such leverage. The West can also act to
                            link the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe more closely to the world
                            economy, raising the costs to the Communist world of applying negative
                            leverage. The East has historically been even less inclined than the
                            West to attempt such leverage, given the costs involved and the
                            probability of failure.</p>

                        <p>Since these countries are united in the Warsaw Pact military alliance, it
                            is not desirable to distinguish among them to any major extent in
                            Western controls on the export of strategic items. On trade in

                            interests and needs among Eastern countries? (see pp. 3-3, 43-44,

                        </p>
                        <p>a. What are the costs and benefits of attempting to bring the Soviet
                            Union and Eastern European countries into the process of assisting
                            development in the Third World or more active involvement in other
                            economic issues? (see pp. 157-167)</p>
                        <p>Eastern assistance to the Third World has historically been largely
                            motivated by Soviet desires for greater political influence. When there
                            are competing factions for government, Soviet aid usually is in support
                            of the faction most vigorously opposed to close ties with the West. On
                            the other hand, constructive Eastern assistance to the Third World could
                            reduce the burden on the West for such assistance.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Union is a major producer and consumer, and an important
                            trader, of oil and gas, but it does not participate in either
                            consumer-country cooperation on energy matters or in the
                            producer-consumer dialogue. Bringing the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> into these talks would add a political East-West
                            element to the already difficult North-South issues, and the risks
                            appear to outweigh the possible benefits.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets are active in the International Wheat Council, the main forum
                            for international efforts to coordinate grain policies. Although the
                            Soviets have not <pb n="25" xml:id="d24-25" facs="d24-25"/>supported the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> position in the IWC, their
                            approach has not been confrontational. We should continue to encourage
                            their participation in these discussions, which are unlikely to
                            complicate North-South relations.</p>
                        <p>b. What policy measures could or should be taken to encourage this type
                            of Eastern involvement in the global economy? (see pp. 161-162)</p>
                        <p>U.S. encouragement of increased Soviet and Eastern European contributions
                            to multilaterally administered aid programs for the Third World in which
                            they are already involved might result in useful burden-sharing without
                            unduly increasing opportunities for counterproductive Soviet activity.
                            Even if unsuccessful in increasing Eastern contributions, <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> efforts in this area could serve to draw

                        <p>January 16, 1973</p>
                        <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT</p>
                        <p>The Boeing Company proposes to sell three 707-320C commercial jet
                            aircraft to the Romanian national airline, at a cost of about $45
                            million. To offset approximately 10 percent of the cost, Boeing would
                            sub-contract for the manufacture in Romania of eight different
                            components for 727 commercial jet aircraft.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense opposes the offset part of the deal.
                            Originally, their opposition was based on the premise that we would be
                            exporting advanced aircraft manufacturing technology to a Warsaw Pact
                            country which could shift this capability from civilian to military
                            uses. Boeing then restructured their proposal, deleting some of the more
                            advanced manufacturing machinery from the equipment that would be sent
                            to Romania. An interagency technical task group reviewed the revised
                            Boeing proposal and the majority concluded that the flow of technology
                            was no longer a security concern.</p>
                        <p>Despite the conclusion of the technical task group, <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> still opposes the offset arrangements
                            because of the precedent it would set. <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                                >DOD</gloss> speculates that, if pressed, the Romanians might agree
                            to delete the offset arrangement and Boeing could still sell the planes.
                            Boeing, on the other hand, feels the arrangement is a “critical element”
                            in a “delicately balanced” proposal.</p>
                        <p>State and Commerce favor granting approval because it might open the
                            Eastern European market for the sale of U. S. commercial aircraft (an
                            important potential market for U. S. exports). Both agencies feel that
                            Boeing's proposed offset arrangements should be accepted and that we
                            must recognize that this is the way of doing business with Eastern
                            Europe.</p>

                        <p>They believe this approach can be managed in future deals so as to not
                            erode a U. S. technological leadership. If Boeing loses the sale the U.
                            S. will lose a $45 million transaction, important to our balance of
                            payments, and a net equivalent of 1,350 jobs for a year at Boeing's
                            plant in Seattle.</p>
                        <p>A <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> waiver will be required for
                            only one piece of manufacturing equipment. This should not cause any
                            difficulty, since a <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> exemption
                            was granted in the past for a larger model of the same equipment.</p>

                            leads us to conclude that the manufacturing techniques and equipment
                            that will be furnished by Boeing to Romania will not jeopardize our
                            national security. Moreover, the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            arguments opposing the offset arrangements, because they set a
                            precedent, are not convincing in my view. Obviously, we must protect
                            vital U. S. technological advantages but this can be done on a
                            case-by-case basis as new deals are proposed.</p>

                        <p>The White House</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I am sorry for the
                            delay, I was talking to the President, who is in Florida. We had much
                            work yesterday.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: Yes, it is a very busy
                            period.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is always a
                            pleasure to welcome representatives of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>. Are you my opposite?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: Not exactly, I deal
                            with economic relations.</p>
                        <p>I was sent by President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>
                            to send to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> a
                            message. I don't know what the possibilities are of my meeting with the
                            President.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He won't be back
                            until Wednesday.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: In the evening?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the evening
                            probably, he is somewhat preoccupied now, if you have read the
                            newspapers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: You don't even need
                            to read them.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: You can't help knowing
                            what's going on. I don't interfere in domestic affairs, not even in my
                            own country.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The both of us. Can
                            you tell me the essence of what President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> has on his mind. You know the view and
                            importance <pb n="2" xml:id="d26-02" facs="d26-02"/>we attach to our
                            relations with you. We will make an effort. Would we announce it?</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: No.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can do it either
                            way. I will make a big effort. It is what your allies the North
                            Vietnamese always say to make a “big effort of good will and serious
                            attempt.” I will make an effort.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: Thank you.</p>
                        <p>After the good health of the two Presidents, the message deals with two
                            parts; bilateral relations and the current international situation.
                            These are the main aspects.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When did you come
                            here?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: Wednesday evening. This
                            is my second time at the White House and before that I was in Washington
                            for four years.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: He is a pioneer in
                            American relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: I left in '62. 1959 to
                            1962.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Did you know that
                            in the Chinese Foreign Office all the white people are in the same
                            department. There is no distinction between ideology.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: That is interesting,
                            the 'white peril'.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The white peril is
                            in one department. There is no classification according to
                            ideologies.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: (Begins the message)
                            There are greetings to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> and his wife from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the practice agreed upon on the occasion of your visit
                            to Romania in 1969 and my visit to the United States in 1970, I felt it
                            necessary to convey to you some considerations of my own regarding
                            bilateral relations and some of the current international questions.</p>
                        <p>1) I would like to express our satisfaction for the positive development
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d26-03" facs="d26-03"/>of relations between
                            Romania and the United States for the favorable settlement of some
                            problems including the Export-Import bank, which started to give some
                            concrete results.</p>
                        <p>This is an oral message.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: For the sake of my
                            stenographer may we have a copy of that?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: No, this is an oral
                            message.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: After you finish
                            may she go over it with you?</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: Certainly.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: ( continues reading) In
                            the same spirit we are expected to get to the point when Most Favored
                            Nation treatment is granted to Romania, which would lead to a
                            substantial growth of our economic relations.</p>
                        <p>2) We would be interested in a wider participation of the United States
                            turning into account some of the natural resources of Romania. We have
                            in mind the participation in: the exploration and exploitation of the
                            oil reserves of the Black Sea and in the extraction and processing of
                            copper deposits, valued at over one billion tons. We would like to
                            achieve this cooperation in mutually advantageous conditions including
                            financial credit arrangements under the terms granted to the developing
                            nations, of which Romania is one.</p>
                        <p>3) At the same time we look with interest to a larger participation of
                            American companies in the achievement of some economic projects in
                            Romania. It is only natural that these companies are expecting an
                            appropriate encouragement from your government.</p>
                        <p>In so far as international topics are concerned: 1) I would like to
                            express our satisfaction for the favorable development of international
                            relations, especially the agreement ending the war in Vietnam, which has
                            created conditions for solutions of other world problems. 2) Taking as a
                            starting point the strengthening of the process of detente in the world,
                            I would like to present a few considerations relating to some of the
                            pending issues. First of all in connection with European Security, as it
                            is known Romania attaches great significance to that achievement in
                            Europe of a cooperation based on principles of full equality, to the
                            creation of an environment apt to guarantee the security and independ
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d26-04" facs="d26-04"/>ence of every nation, and
                            to assure the non-interference into domestic affairs. With that in view
                            Romania is firmly acting for the preparation and the actual taking place
                            of the European Security Conference on security and cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The progress of the Helsinki talks is well known, and I don't want to
                            refer to it again. It is our evaluation that important steps have been
                            taken toward solutions, and that conditions for convening the Conference
                            have been created. However, I could not avoid mentioning that from the
                            development of the preparatory talks in Helsinki and from the exchanges
                            of views I had with representatives of other states, the impression
                            emerged that the United States has reservations and showed somewhat less
                            diminished interest in the taking place of the Conference. We would be
                            only glad to see such assessments and impressions disproved by reality.
                            Romania attaches a great significance to the participation of the United
                            States in process, preparation and holding of the Conference, aware that
                            the position of the United States can have an important role in the
                            works of the Conference and in the favorable solution of European
                            matters. For these reasons we would be interested to see the United
                            States showing a greater interest and contributing more actively to the
                            achievement of understanding, taking into account the interests of all
                            nations and leading to strengthening the peace and security of
                            Europe.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: To help the conference
                            as soon as possible and to have on the agenda the real problems of
                            security.</p>

                            are really important for security like disarmament and force

                            A second aspect relating to the situation in Europe is represented by
                            the talks taking place in Vienna on the reduction of armed forces. As
                            you are well aware, Mr. President, Romania has been constantly
                            preoccupied and vitally interested in the reduction of forces in Central
                            Europe, eventually in the withdrawal of all foreign troops and the
                            reduction of national troops under appropriate conditions. Although in
                            Vienna the subject matter is going to be the reduction of troops in
                            Central Europe, Romania is vitally interested to participate in these
                            talks, both in the preparatory and in the substantive stages, to express
                            her views on all problems. It is understandable that the problem of
                            reduction and withdrawal of troops is of equal concern for Romania as
                            well as for other states because it is an essential part of European
                            security as a whole and of the security of every single European
                            state.</p>
                        <p>Of course we want to make it clear that our participation in the
                            preparatory and substantive negotiations does not mean any desire from
                            our part to become a signatory of the agreements to be concluded. These
                            agreements should be signed by the states directly concerned. However,
                            it would be necessary in our view, that the United States agree with the
                            participation of Romania and other interested states in these
                            negotiations under the conditions I have mentioned before.</p>
                        <p>At the same time Romania would like to see reduction of troops arrived at
                            in other zones. We are particularly interested in the Balkans area. We
                            would welcome with satisfaction any manifestation of the United States'
                            understanding and interest in a meeting among the Balkan countries
                            leading to peace and cooperation in the area.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Is there an agreed
                            upon definition of Balkan area? Does that include Greece?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: And Hungary?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: Of course Greece is
                            included. Hungary would have to be discussed.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: For historical

                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: (finishes the message)
                            In so far as she is concerned, Romania considers that in addition to the
                            Balkan countries other interested countries could take part in such a
                            meeting. We have in mind, in this context, in the first place the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as well as the United States.</p>
                        <p>C) Based on the interest of Romania in all these questions we would
                            highly appreciate if the United States showed a more active interest in
                            their solutions. I am raising this aspect because the impression has
                            been created in Romania and not only in Romania, that the United States
                            is preoccupied by her bilateral relations with other states. In so far
                            as Europe is concerned, she would prefer not to commit herself actively
                            in favor of a positive settlement in the interest of all states of the
                            European problems. We attach a particular importance to the beginning of
                            normalization of the relations between the United States and China. In
                            our view this event is of historical significance for the normalization
                            of the international life. We attach an equal importance to agreements
                            and the understandings reached between the United States and the Soviet
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>We look upon them as contributions to the building of a better world, a
                            world of peace. At the same time we would not like the implementation of
                            these arrangements becoming in any way detrimental to the European
                            security, to the interests of other states including the interests of
                            Romania.</p>
                        <p>I have brought this to your attention, Mr. President, a few thoughts
                            preoccupying me in connection with the evolution and perspectives of
                            today's international life, with the hope that they will be properly <pb
                                n="7" xml:id="d26-07" facs="d26-07"/>understood. They are inspired
                            by the desire motivating Romania's policy, of developing friendly
                            relations with all the states of the world, and of placing as the basis
                            of these relations the principles of full equality, independence and
                            sovereignty. Obviously Romania, within limits of her possibilities, is
                            determined to act for detente and cooperation. We would like to see our
                            relations with the United States taking a more active role within the
                            context of the present atmosphere of detente and cooperation. Such a
                            development would be in the interests of our two peoples and at the same
                            time in the interest of peace and understanding of the world at
                            large.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me make a few
                            preliminary comments and I will recommend a brief meeting with the
                            President. I will let you know when. We appreciate the spirit of this
                            communication, and the attitude that it reflects that Romania and the
                            United States have special bilateral relations, especially between the
                            two Presidents.</p>
                        <p>We will, of course, grant Most Favored Nation status as soon as we have
                            the authorization. We will make sure that this is done before it is
                            granted to other nations that are not as understanding as Romania has
                            proved to be.</p>
                        <p>Have there been any technical discussions about oil?</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: We have had
                            discussions with some companies. Standard Oil and another one are
                            thinking about it.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There is one man
                            from whom I am constantly receiving letters. He claims that he is
                            independent. His name is Philips. He claims to have special competence
                            in offshore oil. If that is true…I don't know the name of his company. I
                            don't even mean to recommend him, I don't even know him. I shook his
                            hand once. But we will encourage anyone else. If they are independent
                            they may be able to move faster. He has a big concession in Korea.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: There is no
                            objection in principle at all.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, in principle
                            there is no objection at all.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: Then there is the
                            problem of financing.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: It is a big
                            arrangement. The oil companies will come to us to ask the
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They will probably
                            want to get guarantees of investment from <pb n="8" xml:id="d26-08"
                                facs="d26-08"/>this government.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: We have to talk about
                            some assistance from the government.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have in the past
                            discussed a special institution for East-West investment. We haven't
                            advanced very far. When <persName corresp="#p_SHH1"
                                >Sonnenfeldt</persName> goes to the Treasury we will be in a better
                            position. We have never had anyone in our economic institution who
                            understands our political strategy. We use economics in conjunction with
                            our political options. Other countries cannot forbid us from having one.
                            That approach will be good for Romania.</p>
                        <p>(to the Ambassador) You are the only Ambassador from Eastern Europe that
                            I ever see, not counting the Soviet Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: That was the starting
                            point of the message.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will pay
                            specific attention to what you raise. I am also getting a man on my
                            staff for this purpose. In regard to the European Security Conference we
                            have never held any objections to the Security Conference. It is not as
                            clear to us what the advantages are, but we have agreed to participation
                            and cooperation. There you have a forum with every Foreign Minister in
                            Europe using it as a field for exercising his ingenuity. And every
                            department head has an opportunity to draft his own proposal. We would
                            like limited agenda items. We would be willing to speed up procedures
                            for short term agreements, especially with our allies in Europe. We are
                            in a positive position. We will not be obstacles and are willing to move
                            rapidly to a conclusion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: We have discussed this
                            with our people in Europe. We want the United States to understand what
                            Romania expects from security. We want the United States to play a more
                            active role.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Your objectives are
                            clear. We don't quarrel; it is also conceivable that the European
                            Security Conference will degenerate into a morass of platitudes. What
                            you say may come about naturally.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: We expect other states
                            to go along with us.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What you are
                            attempting to do is absolutely clear. What others are trying to do is
                            also clear, and the two are not necessarily compatible.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: You spoke about the
                            passivity of the United States and the brilliance of the Foreign
                            Deputies. We want to be more active. I believe we share the same concern
                            that it might lead to the consecrated division <pb n="9" xml:id="d26-09"
                                facs="d26-09"/>in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We should certainly
                            be willing to discuss with you on a private basis some understanding of
                            outcomes, get your views, and talk seriously. In the present state of
                            discussion it is not easy for us to know in which direction to exert
                            pressure.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: I think it is important
                            to start proposals, create conditions, and to expect an outcome.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Our view is to be
                            fairly general and have brief agenda items. Western Europe wants
                            detailed items.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: It is not the length
                            that is important, but the subject. We want to refine. There is always
                            the problem of the subject. Of course the military issues should be
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Force reduction,
                            that is a different thing. Of course, let me know what exclusions you
                            want.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: It is necessary to
                            agree. It is necessary to keep in contact and to follow objectives.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: To complicate
                            intervention of outside forces in Europe is our policy. We are
                            interested in what concretely should be done. I can't guarantee how much
                            pressure we will put on our allies.</p>
                        <p>On force reduction--it is a complex issue because we want to avoid force
                            reduction becoming as general and confused as the European Security
                            Conference. We don't want to open up a host of issues that will make it
                            insoluble.</p>
                        <p>We thought not to include the Balkans, but only the Central Front. As I
                            understand the discussions don't exclude the various countries listening
                            in. But we do think that the actual negotiations should be conducted in
                            a more restricted form. We are prepared to exchange ideas on a bilateral
                            basis and to have your reaction. We would talk seriously.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: We would like the
                            possibility to tell you what we have in mind. The results of these
                            negotiations are important for the security of the whole of Europe. Of
                            course, the agreements should be signed by the countries involved in
                            them, but we think it is important for us to be there.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: I think it a good idea
                            to present a more detailed agenda.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d26-10" facs="d26-10"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Could we have your
                            ideas independent of participation in the discussion?</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: We have had some at
                            the level of the State Department.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: It is a good idea to
                            talk in principle.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On the issue of
                            Balkan security, I have never studied that problem. My studies stopped
                            in 1914. Those talks about the negotiation of a little sliver of land,
                            whose name I don't remember, do you? I have not studied the problem. I
                            don't think the United States has studied it in great detail. I will
                            look into it to find out what the implications are, since every Romanian
                            project is more complicated than it looks. We will look on it with
                            interest. We are not directly involved. We are not as involved there as
                            in Western Europe. Let me study it. I won't be able to give you a formal
                            answer before you leave.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: We are also studying
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: We have repeated it so
                            many times that we are coming to understand it ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: (laughing) That is
                            the great problem of diplomacy. People think once you have proposed
                            something you understand it completely.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: If we have new
                            elements, I will keep you informed.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Big power
                            diplomacy, I take it for an axiom that we cannot let it be used to
                            undermine the interests of other countries. I think some parts of big
                            power diplomacy might even strengthen the position of smaller countries.
                            Smaller countries have the potential of weakening it. Our discussions in
                            Peking and Moscow are in the same order. We will not knowingly make an
                            agreement that sacrifices the interests of other countries. Sometimes we
                            don't know what the other's interests are. We expect Brezhnev to be here
                            this summer, if there are any points that might come up to which you are
                            especially sensitive…You can be certain we will talk very seriously.
                            With Peking we have never discussed Eastern Europe in concrete terms. My
                            impression is that the leaders there wish you well. Our settled policy
                            is not to support newer relations at the expense of the older ones. But,
                            some tendencies can develop. Is there any other subject?</p>
                        <p>We attach importance to staying in close touch. My life is so busy that I
                            cannot always participate in the discussion, but Sonnenfeldt has my
                            total confidence.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d26-11" facs="d26-11"/>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: What will happen when
                            he goes to Treasury?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will still keep
                            in close contact. We will also have <persName corresp="#p_HWG1"
                                >Hyland</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ELS1"

                                >Hyland</persName> should work with you. It is important, if I may
                            so, if you let us know your real thinking on some issues so I can
                            include it in our decisions. We are prepared in the political and
                            economic field to exchange ideas on a very confidential basis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: Thank you. I want to
                            add two other aspects. The possibility of meeting with our President
                            sometime. We already have a history of seven years of good, useful
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Would your
                            President be prepared to come here?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: Yes, or when President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> is in Europe. They are
                            both possibilities.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will consider
                            it. The President has benefited enormously with the meetings with your
                            President. In principle, yes. Now when?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: This year or the
                            beginning of next year. I am not in the position to say definitely.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If the President
                            can go on to Romania from Europe…</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: The official reason
                            our President came here last time was for the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, this could be
                            made an official return visit. This is a more realistic plan. We will be
                            open.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: I am not sure as an
                            official return visit.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> is welcome in Romania
                            anytime.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It was a great
                            experience for all of us there. Let me make a suggestion to you in a
                            week. In principle, a meeting will be arranged.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: The second possibility
                            is some sort of financial arrangements. We have every intention of
                            increasing our relations with the United States in better terms. After
                            the visit of President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>
                            to Africa and Latin America, we will have the cooperation from some of
                            these companies. We want to take American companies with us. For all
                            these aspects we need some credit.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will have to
                            study this. The curious position of American credit in Communist
                            countries is enormous.</p>

                            and with Sonnenfeldt we will have two great minds working on this.</p>
                        <p>Well, Mr. <persName>Consul</persName> and Mr. Ambassador, I will see you
                            again before you leave. I will try to arrange a meeting between you and
                            the President Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">V. Pungan</persName>: Thank you. There is a
                            common thing in the work of our Presidents, they want to see things done
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It has been a great
                            pleasure to see you and your able Ambassador. We have done a lot of
                            things together.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: We still have to
                            finish the roof. Then I can go home.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You are never
                            satisfied.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BC6">Bogdan</persName>: I have to keep my job
                            going.</p>

                            and believe for many reasons that it (the <gloss target="#t_ESC1"

                        <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT</p>
                        <p>In late April, President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>
                            sent a senior adviser, Counselor <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Vasile
                                Pungan</persName>, to Washington to deliver to you a personal
                            message outlining the Romanian President's current thoughts on <gloss

                                >MBFR</gloss>, the possible effects of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> negotiations on
                            Romania, and the desirability of his again visiting the United States
                            sometime this year.</p>
                        <p>I met with Pungan on April 21 and again on April 27 to receive and
                            discuss this message, which was presented orally (the text is at Tab B),
                            to extend your regrets at not being able to meet personally with him,
                            and to assure him that you would be writing to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> within a week or two.</p>
                        <p>The letter for your signature to President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> at Tab A responds to the issues he has raised
                            and notes that you are looking forward to the possibility of his
                            visiting the United States. <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> is eager to do so later this year. Your letter
                            notes that you will continue to place high priority on improving
                            economic relations with Romania. It assures <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is
                            working in earnest toward a constructive <gloss target="#t_CSCE1"
                                >CSCE</gloss> outcome, that we will welcome bilateral consultations
                            on <gloss target="#t_MBFR1">MBFR</gloss>, and that in <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            negotiations you will never do anything consciously that is detrimental
                            to Romania's interests.</p>
                        <p>In response to his expression of satisfaction regarding the Vietnam
                            accords, your letter states that if the peace is to be maintained the
                            North Vietnamese must cease current violations, and expresses the hope
                            that Ceausescu will do what he can to assist in preserving the peace so
                            recently won.</p>
                        <p>Finally, with regard to his visit to the United States, your letter
                            suggests that either November or October might be the best month,
                            following your trip to Europe.</p>

                        <p>The luncheon opened with a reference by the Secretary to the fact that
                            the question of a separate bill to grant <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> to Romania had been raised during his discussions on
                            the terrace with President Ceausescu. (<persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> had touched on this subject with the Secretary
                            and Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> noted that
                            there had previously been bills introduced in Congress to grant <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> to Romania alone.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> said that a
                            separate bill for Romania was a possibility. It would be advisable to
                            call such a bill something other than <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss>, however. A new name such as “equality in trade” would
                            improve the chances of any such legislation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said we would
                            look into the possibility.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> agreed on the
                            desirability of a separate bill as well as of terminology other than
                            “most-favored-nation.”</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said he hoped
                            it would be kept in mind that Romania was a developing country and that
                            it had taken a number of steps such as joining <gloss target="#t_GATT1"
                                >GATT</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_IMF1">IMF</gloss>, etc.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> joked that the
                            Romanian Ambassador was a Stakhanovite on <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss>; if he didn't mention <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> at least 20 times per week he apparently was
                            reprimanded by Bucharest.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said that if it
                            only depended on the Ambassador <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            would be mentioned more than 20 times per week. Many American
                            businessmen came to Romania and when he saw them he had always expressed
                            optimism that <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> would be passed soon
                            but some four years had elapsed since it had been promised and it was
                            rather hard to sustain that optimism.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said the
                            Romanians had been the victims of bad timing. Unfortunately, it had
                            become desirable to add the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and
                            other countries into a general <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            package and difficulties had developed (the question of Jewish
                            emigration from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was briefly
                            alluded to).</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said Romania
                            had nothing against solving the problem in general. That would be a good
                            thing but if the present package becomes more delayed, an alternative
                            should be sought if only on an interim basis. Perhaps <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="d28-03" facs="d28-03"/>a bill could be adopted granting
                            Romania <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> until such time as the
                            general legislation was adopted, when it could be included with other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> said he believed
                            a separate bill for Romania was possible to get through Congress,
                            particularly if the President were to talk with certain key members of
                            the Congress. Then he said it was an “outside possibility” and continued
                            that “we will look into it.” He thought it did make sense still to try
                            to have a general bill.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> observed that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> had already
                            succeeded in overturning two decisions of the United States Government
                            to the consternation of the bureaucracy - the signing by the two
                            Presidents of the joint declaration and President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s agreement to come to a
                            reception at the Romanian Embassy on Wednesday evening.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said that
                            signing the joint declaration “tomorrow” was an important thing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> said jocularly
                            that his people in charge of arrangements wouldn't talk to him, because
                            they thought he was responsible for changing the program. He remarked
                            that <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> had shown himself
                            to be very skillful at extracting concessions.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said he hadn't
                            intended to ask for concessions until the following day's discussions
                            with the President. But because the Secretary of the Treasury was
                            present at this luncheon he would say something now so that what he had
                            to say tomorrow would not come as a big surprise to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>. In 1969, the question had
                            arisen of giving some preferences to Romania as a developing country
                            including credits on special terms. Possibly he would raise this now,
                            especially in relation to petroleum.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said Romania
                            was interested in finding ways of developing its natural resources.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> said he had the
                            impression this question of low interest credits was only in reference
                            to the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_IMF1"
                                >IMF</gloss>. The United States Government provided 40% of the funds
                            for these organizations as far as concessional credits were <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="d28-04" facs="d28-04"/>concerned. Of course, the granting of
                            credits depended on the stage of development. Romania considers itself a
                            developing country but there are many countries that are more
                            underdeveloped. Furthermore, United States-Romanian trade is increasing
                            rapidly and much of the increase in United States exports to Romania is
                            based on credits from the Export-Import Bank. The <gloss
                                target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> Bank must look at the soundness of
                            the projects it agrees to finance but it has obviously found that most
                            of the projects with Romania have been in this category.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said Romania
                            had taken some <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> loans but they had
                            been at 6% interest and short term. As for loans from the World Bank, no
                            one knows the national origin of the particular money loaned. Romania
                            had received a credit from the Chinese several years ago for zero
                            percent interest. When certain other countries criticized us for taking
                            such loans from the Chinese, we indicated our belief in equality of
                            treatment by offering to have similar credit arrangements with them and
                            said we would give plenty of publicity to them.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>. I nominate you
                            to be Secretary of the Treasury in order to bring us some of these zero
                            percent loans. The prime lending rate here is now almost 10%.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>. You know the
                            commercial rates we get from Europe are 5%. We are thinking of credits
                            of $500- 600 million, a sum which will in the long run favor U.S.
                            industries by promoting cooperation in industrial fields. We don't want
                            to use it for roads or consumer goods.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. You get that
                            from <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName> tomorrow. Then I will
                            know we are dealing with a master negotiator.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>. I am sorry we
                            didn't get him (<persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>) to
                            Romania first. But (turning to <persName corresp="#p_SGP1"
                                >Shultz</persName>) I hope you will come to Romania anyway and if
                            you give the loan first, your welcome will be even greater.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_HHHJ1">Humphrey</persName> (to <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>). You should be looking,
                                <persName corresp="#p_GS1">George</persName>, at export credit
                            promotion. We wanted it earlier to compete better with the Japanese but
                            it got tied in Congress to foreign aid and was defeated. I have always
                            been for an export credit promotion fund to help exports of American
                            products. We can't get it now but if the energy crisis continues and
                            there is more unemployment, we may get it.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d28-05" facs="d28-05"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>. We need
                            legislation with economic appeal rather than aid. (To <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>) Do I understand you are not
                            too satisfied with the <gloss target="#t_IBRD1">IBRD</gloss> after
                            joining it?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>. We have been
                            members only a year. It is too early and we have too little experience
                            to criticize.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>: No, we would do
                            like you. We would put some in an international fund and some we would
                            use ourselves. You know that we give some aid to more underdeveloped
                            countries. And to get raw materials, we provide some credits to the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to assure supplies of raw
                            materials. The interest rate we charge is only 2% but we get access to
                            the raw materials.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. I gather you
                            borrow at zero percent from the Chinese and lend at 2% to the
                            Russians.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>. Not quite! We
                            are thinking of the credit for the delivery of machinery from the U.S.
                            Actually, it would really amount to credits to U.S. industry to
                            stimulate production.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>. Have you thought
                            of the amount of credits outstanding and the burdens of repayment and
                            interest?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>. That is why we
                            ask for 2%; we can get 10% credits anywhere. In Deutschemarks we borrow
                            at 6%. Next year, we will have equilibrium in our balance of payments.
                            In practical terms, we are able to repay all our credits. They amount to
                            $4 billion (plus) over a number of years. We will be able to cover both
                            credit repayments and necessary imports.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. (Begins
                            toast). (Toast refers to good relations, especially since 1969 and
                            useful role played by Romania.) It has been a member of a different
                            social system but has always recognized the importance of its own
                            independent course and these are objectives we share. Therefore, it has
                            been easy for us to work together. (Reference to being present at all
                            three meetings with President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> and President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>. Thank you for
                            your kind words about Romania's role and also the good relationship
                            between the two countries. There actually was an earlier talk with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> when you were not
                            present - in 1967 when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>
                            was a private citizen. I have, in fact, had many meetings <pb n="6"
                                xml:id="d28-06" facs="d28-06"/>with people of many different
                            philosophies. Many changes have occurred in recent years but this was
                            only the beginning. Changes will be even more rapid hereafter. The
                            technological and scientific revolutions and economic relations will
                            produce many changes -- and these will also have a profound effect on
                            political relationships. Before, it took 100 years for great empires to
                            collapse. Now things are moving much more rapidly. (Smilingly) There are
                            no empires now, of course. (Someone commented in way that raised
                            question of the U.S. President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> appeared to be excluding the U.S. from the
                            above.) I think you have no reason to worry. One hundred years ago you
                            were nothing. Now you have become a great power. (Smilingly) You know it
                            is said once that the last would be first. The U.S. proves this. But all
                            of this requires us to proceed to give more attention to relations
                            between states; more rights to medium and smaller countries. Each small
                            country is not a force by itself, but taken together, all are important.
                            Also we cannot rule out new regroupments of countries at any time. We
                            need to build a new world without confrontations. We need new
                            regroupments. Romania has always advocated having good relations between
                            all countries. Settlement of conflicts like the Middle East will be in
                            the interests of all. We are not completely disinterested in Romania in
                            saying this, of course. Only in peace can we have a fast rate of
                            progress. (Toast ended)</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>. There are new
                            powers centers. I note the importance of China. Europe will become more
                            powerful.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. East and West
                            Europe together or separately?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>. I refer in the
                            first place to the Common Market. But I also have in mind that there are
                            also those who want to see all of Europe together play a more important
                            role in policy. Then there are Asia, Africa and Latin America which will
                            grow in importance.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. I agree that
                            the historical process will accelerate.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>. It is
                            necessary to abolish nuclear weapons. Eventually all countries will get
                            these otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Several Americans. Agree</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>. Then there are
                            chemical and bacteriological weapons which could be even more
                            devastating.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. That would be
                            more absurd because of the nature of the results.</p>

                            CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE RIGHTS OF SMALL NATIONS AND STANDS FIRM FOR
                            ROMANIAN INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY. CEAUSESCU URGED SEPARATE AND

                        <p>2. DISCUSSION WITH THE PRESIDENT DECEMBER 4: THE PRESIDENT NOTED HOW MANY
                            CHANGES THERE HAD BEEN SINCE HE AND PRESIDENT <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >CEAUSESCU</persName> BEGAN DEALING WITH EACH OTHER IN 1967 AND
                            1969. <persName corresp="#p_CN4">CEAUSESCU</persName> AGREED, RECALLED
                            HOW ROMANIA HAD WELCOMED THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND
                            THE AGREEMENTS WITH THE SOVIET UNION. STATED, HOWEVER, THAT WHILE THE
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, CHINA AND <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, AS BIG POWERS, HAD AN IMPORTANT ROLE
                            TO PLAY, OTHER STATES LIKE ROMANIA MUST NOT BE IGNORED. HE HOPED THAT
                            THE IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> AND THE <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> ON THE ONE
                            HAND AND THE <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> AND CHINA ON THE OTHER
                            WOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF OTHER
                            STATES. HE SAID THESE WERE SENTIMENTS WHICH HE DID NOT HIDE FROM EITHER
                            THE CHINESE OR THE SOVIETS. THE PRESIDENT COMMENTED THAT NEITHER HIS
                            VISIT TO CHINA NOR HIS MEETINGS WITH THE SOVIET LEADER HAD MET WITH
                            UNIVERSAL APPROVAL, BUT THAT SO FAR AS SMALLER STATES WERE CONCERNED, A
                            DEFINITE EFFORT HAD BEEN MADE TO INCLUDE LANGUAGE IN THE COMMUNIQUES OR
                            AGREEMENTS CONCLUDED WITH THE SOVIETS AND THE CHINESE RESPECTING AND
                            PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF ALL NATIONS FROM BEING JEOPARDIZED BY SUCH
                            AGREEMENTS. HE ASSURED PRESIDENT CEAUSESCU THAT HE STANDS ABSOLUTELY
                            FIRM FOR ROMANIAN INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY AND THAT SO FAR AS THE
                            UNITED STATES IS CONCERNED, NO COUNTRY NEED HAVE ANY FEAR THAT WE WILL
                            USE OUR POWER TO DOMINATE OTHER COUNTRIES OR INFRINGE ON THEIR
                            INDEPENDENCE -- THIS BEING THE CORNERSTONE OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY.
                            IN RESPONSE TO CEAUSESCU QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THERE COULD BE DETENTE
                            WITHOUT CONDOMINIUM THE PRESIDENT REPLIED THAT IT IS INDEED POSSIBLE TO
                            HAVE DETENTE WITHOUT CONDOMINIUM.</p>

                        <p>3. THE PRESIDENT POINTED OUT THE NEED FOR GOOD RELATIONS BETWEEN THE
                            UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION, BUT INDICATED THAT NEITHER HE NOR
                            SECRETARY-GENERAL <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">BREZHNEV</persName> HAD
                            ANY ILLUSIONS AS TO THE FACT THAT OUR INTERESTS COLLIDE IN VARIOUS PARTS
                            OF THE WORLD. WHAT HAS TO BE DONE IS TO SEE THAT THESE COLLISIONS DO NOT
                            RESULT IN AN EXPLOSION. THE PRESIDENT STRESSED HIS BELIEF THAT WE HAVE
                            ESTABLISHED AT LEAST A BEGINNING OF A STRUCTURE WHERE DIFFERENCES CAN BE
                            SETTLED PEACEFULLY.</p>
                        <p>4. <persName corresp="#p_CN4">CEAUSESCU</persName> EXPRESSED HIS GREAT
                            SATISFACTION WITH WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD SAID, REITERATED HIS
                            UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF BIG POWERS, BUT CAME BACK AGAIN TO THE NEED
                            FOR BIG POWERS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERESTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES
                            LEST MISCALCULATIONS BE MADE OF THOSE COUNTRIES INTERESTS.</p>
                        <p>5. AT MEETING OF DECEMBER 5, THE FOLLOWING TOPICS WERE COVERED: <list>

                                    PENDING ADOPTION OF GENERAL LEGISLATION. THE PRESIDENT INDICATED
                                    THAT MFN POSED A VERY DIFFICULT-POLITICAL PROBLEM, BUT HE
                                    ASSURED <persName corresp="#p_CN4">CEAUSESCU</persName> THAT THE

                                    WITH ROMANIA TO FIND A SOLUTION. HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT WE WOULD
                                    ENCOURAGE AMERICAN BUSINESS TO TAKE FAVORABLE ATTITUDES TOWARD
                                    ROMANIA.</item>

                                        <gloss target="#t_MBFR1">MBFR</gloss>, HE EXPRESSED THE
                                    OPINION THAT THINGS WERE NOT GOING THAT WELL BECAUSE NOT ALL OF
                                    CENTRAL EUROPE IS BEING DISCUSSED AND BECAUSE THE REDUCTIONS
                                    BEING CONSIDERED ARE ONLY SYMBOLIC. THE PRESIDENT COMMENTED THAT
                                    DISCUSSIONS ON MBFR ARE GOING TO BE DIFFICULT BUT THAT WE WILL
                                    BEAR IN MIND THE CONCERN FOR COUNTRIES LIKE ROMANIA. SIMILARLY,
                                    WITH CSCE WE ARE SENSITIVE TO THE INTERESTS OF ROMANIA AND OTHER

                                <item>C. MIDDLE EAST - CEAUSESCU URGED THAT PROVISION BE MADE FOR
                                    PALESTINIAN REPRESENTATION AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE. THE
                                    SECRETARY COMMENTED THAT SUCH PARTICIPATION AT THE BEGINNING, IN
                                    THE OPINION OF ALL THE PARTICIPANTS, RAISED TOO MANY PROBLEMS,
                                    BUT THE QUESTION COULD BE DISCUSSED DURING THE FIRST PHASE. HE
                                    ADDED THAT FROM OUR VIEWPOINT SUCH PARTICIPATION IS NOT
                                    EXCLUDED. CEAUSESCU ALSO RAISED THE DESIRABILITY OF OTHER STATES
                                    ASIDE FROM THE US AND THE SOVIET UNION TAKING PLACE IN THE
                                    CONFERENCE. AMONG SUCH STATES MIGHT BE ROMANIA. HE ARGUED THAT
                                    WHILE THE MAIN THING WAS, OF COURSE, TO REACH RESULTS DURING THE
                                    CONFERENCE, NONETHELESS, PARTICIPATION OF OTHER COUNTRIES MIGHT
                                    KEEP ALL THE BLAME, IF THINGS DIDN'T GO WELL, FROM BEING PUT ON
                                    THE SOVIET UNION AND THE UNITED STATES. THE PRESIDENT COMMENTED
                                    THAT PARTICIPATION OF OTHER COUNTRIES WAS NOT A CLOSED QUESTION.
                                    HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT SO FAR AS WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
                                    WERE CONCERNED, THEY HAVE TAKEN A PAROCHIAL VIEW AND HAVE NOT
                                    BEEN HELPFUL, HAVING THOUGHT MORE ABOUT THE FRUITS OF THE
                                    CONFERENCE THAT ABOUT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. THE SECRETARY
                                    POINTED OUT THAT EVEN AMONG EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ROMANIA
                                    HAD BEEN THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE MAINTAINED RELATIONS OVER THE
                                    YEARS WITH BOTH PARTIES TO THE CONFLICT.</item>

                        <p>President: Yes. I want to visit Romania as soon as our mutual schedules
                            can be worked out.</p>
                        <p>[The press is ushered out.]</p>

                            maintain relations.</p>

                            asked me to emphasize his desire and efforts to improve relations, and
                            to have personal relations with you. Our relationship is important to
                            us, and a visit from time to time is important in this regards.</p>
                        <p>President: The American people, the Congress and I treasure our
                            friendship with the Romanians, and if we can get over all the problems
                            here we can strengthen those ties.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Pungan</persName>: President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> asked me to bring a few
                            matters to your attention.</p>
                        <p>First, Europe. He is pleased with the results of the Conference on
                            Security and Cooperation in Europe, but there is some delay in the
                            Conference and in having the final phase at the highest level by the end
                            of the year. He asked your help to see the second stage finalized and
                            preparations made for the third stage. We think this Conference can
                            bring more cooperation and confidence.</p>
                        <p>President: I think we are eager to move it along, aren't we?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes, we are prepared
                            to encourage the Europeans, but not to strain our relations with them in
                            order to do it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Pungan</persName>: We understand but we see
                            some favorable benefits which would make desirable an early Conference
                            at the highest level. It is especially important on Confidence-Building
                            Measures and those measures leading to detente. We think the United
                            States can help.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We support the
                            Romanian position. But in the area of human contacts, the West Europeans
                            are being extreme. In the areas of maneuvers and movement of forces, our
                            views are similar to the Romanians!</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Pungan</persName>: We want to see increased
                            contacts, but it is a delicate matter.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. President, I told
                            him yesterday that the Communists have specialized in taking and holding
                            power and aren't likely to be overthrown by accident through increased
                            contacts. What the Romanians want is to prevent the large movement of
                            forces to bring pressure.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d30-03" facs="d30-03"/>
                        <p>President: I know you are interested in the Trade Bill and <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>. We are working for a good bill and I
                            think we are close to a good compromise.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Pungan</persName>: I think you will succeed
                            by the end of the year.</p>
                        <p>President: We will be very disappointed if it doesn't happen.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Pungan</persName>: Another problem is Cyprus.
                            It is close to us, and prolongation of the conflict increases the
                            danger. At some time, we want to see the right solution--withdrawal of
                            foreign troops, the independence of Cyprus, and both sides to live in
                            peace on the island.</p>
                        <p>President: We are working to try to be helpful. We want withdrawal, a
                            ceasefire until then, and a stable solution. We have been working with
                            the Greeks, Turks and the Cypriots.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Pungan</persName>: I am sure the United
                            States can help find a good solution.</p>
                        <p>Another problem is Korea. The North Korean leadership wants to have
                            confidential contacts with the United States for discussions. They have
                            suggested Romania. President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> has offered to help if you want to do it.</p>
                        <p>President: We are grateful for your offer. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> and I will discuss it in
                            detail. Certain things must precede such contacts. We don't want to go
                            in without firm understandings. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> will contact your Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will talk and then
                            relay our ideas through your Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Pungan</persName>: I will tell the North
                            Koreans and hope you will have a good answer.</p>
                        <p>The last question is the Middle East. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> thinks a delay in further
                            progress is leading to new tensions and the possibility of war. We think
                            the Geneva Conference should start again.</p>
                        <p>President: We are keeping the process moving. We have been meeting with
                            Arab leaders, and we will meet soon with Saqqaf and Rabin. We agree that
                            more movement is essential, and we are working toward that, but we may
                            differ on whether the best way is Geneva or bilaterally.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Pungan</persName>: But it is useful to have
                            talks going on and some sense of progress. We need confidence that the
                            next step will come.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Romania is the only
                            country in Eastern Europe that did not break relations with Israel.</p>
                        <p>President: We have to keep things moving.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PV1">Pungan</persName>: You have done so much, but
                            we hope you will do more. Any time there are mutual problems which you
                            think we should discuss, please get in touch and we will cooperate
                            closely for the best solution.</p>
                        <p>President: You have been extremely helpful. Our relationship with Romania
                            is excellent and we want to make it better. We appreciate your offer on
                            North Korea. We will be back to you.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I'm sorry your
                            visit is so short. Perhaps next time you can stay longer in order to see
                            more of our country.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would like
                            to.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Perhaps after
                            peace is concluded in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I wouldn't
                            like to wait so long.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: In any case, I
                            want to welcome you and express the satisfaction our leadership feels in
                            the good relations that exist between Romania and the <gloss

                            short, will be useful.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I would like
                            to tell you, Mr. President, that the good relations initiated by
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> are firmly fixed
                            and the fact that we have had a change of administration no way affect
                            the direction established President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>. As a matter of fact, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> is prepared, as I am, to continue
                            along this course and intensify it. We appreciate these occasions to
                            keep abreast of your thinking as provided recently when you sent a
                            special emissary to the United States and we feel that this practice of
                            confidential exchanges at a high level should be maintained.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d31-02" facs="d31-02"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I appreciate
                            very much both your statements as well as the wish expressed by
                            President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> and by you, Mr.
                            Secretary of State, to continue the understandings achieved with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> in which you had
                            participated most actively. For our part we really desire that these
                            relations continue in all spheres. In accord with our tradition of
                            letting the guest decide with what subject he would like to begin, where
                            would you like to start?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr.
                            President, you have been so courteous to receive me at what must be an
                            inconvenient time. I am prepared to cover all topics following any order
                            you prefer. Incidentally, we will follow our usual custom and keep the
                            record of these discussions in the White House and not with the State
                            Department. While there are always leaks, none ever come out of the
                            White House. I always say I read the New York Times because it gives me
                            a better selection of my own cables than my associates do.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>.: They must
                            have a good intelligence service.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: My practice
                            is to keep information away from where it can leak.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Let's begin
                            perhaps with Romanian-American relations. The time of President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s visit was just before
                            the Congress of our Party and now we are just a few weeks away from our
                            11th Party Congress.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You delayed
                            it by one day.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Yes, we
                            delayed it by one day.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We haven't
                            forgotten that.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Of course the
                            Situation has changed a great deal since then. At that time in the world
                            the visit was criticized a lot by our <pb n="3" xml:id="d31-03"
                                facs="d31-03"/>friends. We are now in a situation where we can
                            criticize them.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: For what?
                            Having too good relations with the United States?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: No, but rather
                            to prevent some agreements of theirs. So we act in such a way that they
                            would not reach agreements which would be at others' expense. We can
                            discuss this at another point in more detail.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What
                            agreements arrived at, at the expense of others?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I was
                            referring to the fact that we are in a position to make criticisms in
                            order to prevent their reaching agreements at the expense of others.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's a good
                            strategy.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: To return then
                            to our relations with the US. In 1969 we announced that the United
                            States would accord the most-favored nation clause to Romania and that
                            there would be an expansion of our relations including an Increase in
                            our commercial exchanges severalfold. Trade has increased to be sure it
                            was very slow volume-wise, but the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>
                            matter has remained in the world of declarations. Perhaps we can declare
                            at the Party Congress, which is only a few weeks off, that the United
                            States has granted <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr.
                            President, on the issue of <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>, I don't
                            want to bore you with the domestic problems which have arisen. We hope
                            the legislation will pass in two or three weeks. As soon as it is passed
                            we will grant Romania <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>. There is a
                            slight problem with the <persName corresp="#p_JHM1">Jackson</persName>
                            Amendment which I should probably discuss with your Ambassador, but we
                            have to show some recognition of it in order to avoid <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="d31-04" facs="d31-04"/>difficulties later. I don't
                            personally want to raise this question because I don't consider it
                            appropriate. It would constitute an intervention in your internal
                            affairs. There is not of course the same problem here as in the <gloss

                            as not to complicate things. We would accept any gesture by Romania as
                            complying with the Amendment. I don't think there are many people
                            involved. (At this point the Secretary asked the Ambassador for some
                            details and the Ambassador mentioned the two categories of dual
                            nationals and relatives of American citizens with 175 cases of the
                            former and several hundred of the latter plus family members.)</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Actually, the
                                <persName corresp="#p_JHM1">Jackson</persName> Amendment needs some
                            filling out as far as Romania is concerned in the sense that in addition
                            to the demands for granting the right of emigration, which is granted by
                            Romania, there should also be a reference to the right to return to
                            one's country of origin because it seems this problem is beginning to
                            appear.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: With Jewish
                            migration or others?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Jewish in
                            particular. This is something we're negotiating directly with the
                            Israelis.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't
                            believe Jewish emigration would be a major problem, but something
                            regarding dual nationals and families or American citizens of a symbolic
                            nature would remove any doubts on this question. Our intention is to
                            grant <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> to Romania within a few weeks
                            after passage of the legislation and before we grant it anywhere else in
                            Eastern Europe. This does not have to await the gestures which the
                            Romanian side would make, but we would expect that within a month or two
                            thereafter you would carry out what we had agreed on.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: It seems to me
                            that this is a problem which isn't well understood. We don't have an <pb
                                n="5" xml:id="d31-05" facs="d31-05"/>emigration problem. To be sure,
                            people are emigrating in smaller numbers now, some to Israel but
                            substantial numbers are leaving especially for the German Federal
                            Republic. In general, there are still about 55-60,000 of Jewish origin
                            in Romania but those who want to leave are actually very few number.
                            There isn't really any problem from this standpoint.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The only
                            problem that exists concerns the families of American citizens and dual
                            nationals. I'm sure the problem can be worked out. It doesn't really
                            concern many people.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: (To the
                            Ambassador) Have you made some requests? How many are there?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHGJ1">Barnes</persName>: About 175 dual
                            nationals and several hundred with relatives in the United States plus
                            their families.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: That's not
                            many. As a matter of fact we have very good relations with Americans of
                            Romanian origin In the United States and many of them come back here to
                            visit. Basically then I don't really see that there exists a problem in
                            this matter.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I don't
                            believe there is either, I just mention this question in passing. In a
                            few weeks after legislation is adopted we will grant <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> to Romania before any other Eastern
                            European country.</p>
                        <p>(The Ambassador recalled to the Secretary the likely legislative
                            provision that a commercial agreement would have to be negotiated before
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> could be granted.)</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador tells me that the legislation will require a trade
                            agreement to be concluded between our two countries covering such
                            matters as business facilities. I <pb n="6" xml:id="d31-06"
                                facs="d31-06"/>suggest a begin consideration of that agreement now
                            and try to have it finished by the time the bill passes. It shouldn't be
                            a particularly demanding question and I suggest the Ambassador begin
                            here and conclude negotiations within a month. These are basically
                            standard provisions. We will expedite procedures in Washington though I
                            despair at times whether we can ever do anything in four weeks. Still,
                            this shouldn't be difficult because it is a standard type of
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I proposed
                            last December that we conclude an economic agreement and I was just
                            thinking about proposing again that we conclude a similar agreement so
                            I'm completely of the same mind as you.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I remember
                            but this agreement will not be an economic one but the standard
                            commercial types</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I'd like the
                            economic one to be one on cooperation also in the technical and
                            scientific fields and to be over a long-term nature. We have such
                            agreements with almost all the Western European countries.</p>
                        <p>(The Ambassador reminded the Secretary that negotiations would be
                            beginning next month on the cultural-scientific-technological agreement
                            and therefore the long-term economic agreement need cover only those
                            aspects in the technical and scientific field which would not be covered
                            in the other agreement.)</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let's do the
                            commercial agreement first, then <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>,
                            then the long-term economic agreement including whatever scientific
                            matters are not covered by the cultural agreement.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I agree.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: If our
                            schedule holds, we could begin on the long-term agreement early next
                            year.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d31-07" facs="d31-07"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I completely
                            agree. As far as the citizens are concerned (at this point <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> turned to Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_MG4">Macovescu</persName>), I think we need to
                            look again at these eases and to solve all of them so that this won't
                            have to be a matter for discussion in the future.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I'll let our
                            Ambassador follow up on this. I didn't even know that we had these
                            problems until I read some material on the way here.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: We have some
                            problems in that there are some who want to come back to Romania but we
                            regard this as normal. Therefore from this standpoint I don't see that
                            any problems will appear.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned that we have achieved some expansion in our commercial
                            exchanges but we'd like it to be still greater and also we'd like the
                            Government of the United States to encourage investments in Romania, as
                            well as finding perhaps some way of granting credits under more
                            favorable conditions to Romania as a developing country, all this in
                            connection with cooperative ventures with American firms.</p>
                        <p>(The Secretary asked, the Ambassador if Romania did not benefit from
                            Ex-Im credits and World Bank loans. The Ambassador said yes, but added
                            that <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> was probably
                            thinking of credits authorized under AID- type legislation for
                            developing countries.)</p>
                        <p>We have in mind in Romania the construction at several large irrigation
                            schemes, also systems to regulate flood waters and reclaim land, all of
                            which should lead toward an increase of agricultural production.
                            American investments might contribute toward this end. Of course, the
                            industrial area remains important.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d31-08" facs="d31-08"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We would be
                            prepared to send our Secretary of Agriculture here.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHGJ1">Barnes</persName>: Secretary of
                            Agriculture Hardin was in Romania several years ago and Secretary Butz
                            has invited Minister of Agriculture Miculescu to the United States.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are
                            sympathetic to any ideas you may have in the agricultural and industrial
                            fields. I recall in the past we once helped you with credits through the
                            private banking system to get some investments and we are prepared to
                            use our influence wherever we can. The only sources I know of, though,
                            are the Ex-Im Bank and the World Bank. In those international
                            institutions where we have influence we'd be glad to exercise it. The
                            best way to proceed is for your Ambassador to raise specific projects
                            and we will use what influence we have either in the domestic or
                            international field to obtain what is a possible. Our basic attitude is
                            positive and our general policy is to keep Romania the head of the line
                            as far as Eastern Europe is concerned although I must say it is
                            extremely difficult for our economic agencies to understand that.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: In any ease in
                            either the agricultural or industrial fields, particularly the matter or
                            raw materials or even minerals which we have admittedly of low grade
                            type but still in huge quantities, in these areas we could work out good
                            cooperation with American firms in suitable conditions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In
                            agriculture, I am giving a major speech, at the World Food Conference
                            which will give our approach to the problems of agriculture. It will
                            represent a new departure for us who have hitherto relied almost
                            entirely on the free market. For the first time we are trying to solve
                            these problems on a <pb n="9" xml:id="d31-09" facs="d31-09"
                            />governmental basis. I think there may be some aspects of this speech
                            of interest to Romania. We can pursue these discussions in Washington
                            and we would take your approach seriously.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I agree.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Fine. By the
                            way, I told the Foreign Minister earlier that we would be prepared to do
                            something on <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credits for cotton but
                            on feed grains all I can do is to look into the matter when I get back
                            home.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: We have a
                            program to exploit some copper deposits; although they have not too high
                            a cooper content they can be handled through the open pit method and are
                            therefore economical. If the United States would be interested, then
                            American firms could participate with some investments advantageously
                            priced as far as interest is concerned and could be paid back in
                            ore.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This could be
                            something for the Ex-Im Bank to get into. What about contacts with
                            American firms, do you have them?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: We have. But
                            credits at a high interest rate don't interest us.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I
                            understand.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: American
                            companies are suggesting that we be more insistent with the
                            Administration.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I've talked
                            to you I believe at least once before about my views concerning the
                            heads of American companies. Marx and Lenin were not right in their view
                            that capitalists would understand the political interests of their
                            countries. They are idiots. I'm talking about them in the political
                            realm, not the economic which is something else. In any case, it's not

                                xml:id="d31-10" facs="d31-10"/>something. What we do has to do with
                            the state of our political relations. I just wanted to as this in
                            passing.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I appreciate
                            what you have said. Still, I think that they appreciate the political
                            aspect. The combination of this political aspect with the economic one
                            shows that they are true Marxists.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: They're
                            idiots, I know them. Last year the head of one of the oil companies
                            called on King Faisal shortly after the embargo and congratulated him on
                            it and said that it was long overdue. The individual is no longer Saudi
                            Arabia.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: What about
                            freedom of expression?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Certainly.
                            Whatever they want to say, they can, in Europe, for example, but in
                            Saudi Arabia where they want our political protection, they cannot talk
                            against their own government's policy, if they want that protection.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: You know, as
                            far as Romania is concerned judgment is good enough. They say that the
                            United States gives out several billions of dollars in credits at low
                            interest rates and several billions in aid. And hardly any of it ever
                            comes back. Whereas if some credits here provided to Romania for some of
                            the productive purses we have been talking about, this would be
                            advantageous both for the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and
                            Romania.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree. I
                            think the way to proceed is for these companies to develop projects,
                            then submit them to the Ex-Im Bank and if they're then considered to be
                            economically feasible we will give political approval and will in fact
                            encourage them.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d31-11" facs="d31-11"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: A political
                            credit is basically what I after.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That would
                            require Congressional action, and in the present state of Congress would
                            be very difficult, but if we look ahead a few years and as we get
                            control of this situation, which I believe we can, perhaps we can think
                            about it again.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Last of all,
                            not long ago I sent one of my Counselors to the United States and he had
                            discussions with you and the President. I want to raise the question of
                            the President's visit to Romania. I don't know whether it's possible to
                            have in mind the idea of next year for this visit to take place.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You were very
                            generous to invite the President. He and I have actually been discussing
                            the matter. Our basic attitude is positive, but of course he has to go
                            to Western Europe first at some point. One idea was to come in
                            connection with the European Security Council session at the highest
                            level, after that to Eastern Europe and certainly to Romania, in fact
                            only to Romania. Let us try to take 1975 as a target date.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I agree.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This guest
                            house where I'm staying is very elegant. That of course isn't the
                            principal reason why he would come but it would be very pleasant. It
                            would be useful for us to plan for 1975.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MG4">Macovescu</persName>: Could
                            we mention this in the communique.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There is some
                            uncertainty in the President's program. If we could state that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> was interested in
                            the visit taking place in 1975, that I expressed President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>'s appreciation, this might do;
                            however <pb n="12" xml:id="d31-12" facs="d31-12"/>various things could
                            intervene so one can't be 100% sure. There are sometimes difficulties if
                            you give a date and then can't meet that date. Let's say instead the
                            President was invited for an early date. I would accept it on his behalf
                            and say we would try to arrange a visit at an early convenient date.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Let's try to
                            find a formula.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That would be
                            better than saying 1975. Let's issue the communique from here
                            tonight.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Fine.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There's no
                            great hurry. It could be any time tonight.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Until 6 a.m.
                            it's still evening in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Let's refer
                            also to the beginning of negotiations for the commercial treaty and also
                            to a long-term agreement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Agreed.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Also we ought
                            to mention the encouragement or exchanges of private citizens in the
                            context of the principles we agreed to.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: As a matter
                            of fact this would help us.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHGJ1">Barnes</persName>: Perhaps we
                            could draw on the December 1973 language and refer to humanitarian
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's a good
                            idea.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: We could say
                            we were supporting the solution of humanitarian problems, especially
                            since we have some problems of this sort with the United States so I'm
                            therefore quite ready to accept this language.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Really?</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="d31-13" facs="d31-13"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: With the
                            church. I don't want to discuss it really. I was thinking about the
                            Romanian Orthodox Church which has ties with our church here.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There is an
                            Orthodox priest who gives us a lot of trouble but he's not Romanian.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Shall we turn
                            to international matters?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: By all means.
                            Why don't you begin and I'll give my views.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: It would be
                            better if you began. You've traveled a lot, you have many impressions
                            and probably you could choose something more interesting.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I'm ready to
                            discuss any subject of interest to you, but I might start by talking
                            about Latin America.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: We pay a lot
                            of attention to the development of our relations with Latin America.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I know the
                            Foreign Minister has just been Mexico.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: And we have
                            friendship treaties with two countries in Latin America.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Which
                            ones?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Argentina and
                            Costa Rica. We have good relations with almost all Latin American
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Well, let's begin with the situation in Europe. There is first of all the
                            concrete problem of the European Security Conference and then the more
                            general situation that exists. There are certain states of things which
                            lead to very grave problems such as that of Cyprus. I want to mention
                            several things which sometimes people pass by with out giving them too
                            much attention in terms <pb n="14" xml:id="d31-14" facs="d31-14"/>of
                            trying to solve them. Despite the fact that a series of good results
                            have been obtained in a variety of countries, the situation continues to
                            be rather complicated and in many respects similar to that just prior to
                            the Second World War.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In
                            Europe?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: In Europe. And
                            in the whole word for that matter.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Why in
                            Europe? I can see why in other parts of the world.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Things need to
                            a seen in close connection with the energy and financial crises, with a
                            whole set of economic situations which create rather serious problems.
                            Then there's this shifting, also rather serious, of financial means
                            which creates problems in the economic domain and as a consequence the
                            political domain as well.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree about
                            these phenomena. They are serious problems.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: It's difficult
                            to say how various countries will act to solve these problems. In the
                            past, especially In Europe, states resorted to the military path. Then
                            there are unsolved problems in Europe, despite that some steps have been
                            taken and some understandings realized. The Cyprus situation is eloquent
                            testimony of this state of affairs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It proves
                            that there's no medicine for stupidity. Between the Greek and Turkish
                            military they've made a mess of extraordinary proportions.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Viewed from
                            another angle, there's a very high concentration of military forces in
                                <pb n="15" xml:id="d31-15" facs="d31-15"/>Europe, the biggest
                            concentration in any one area, and without precedent in the past. Europe
                            remains in our opinion, problem number one which needs more
                            concentration, although there are of course other danger spots in other
                            places.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree that
                            it is problem number one.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Or course this
                            raises the question of how one should solve these very complicated
                            problems. To be consistent with the approach I've used in the past, I
                            want to tell you frankly some of our thoughts.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's why I
                            wanted you to talk first.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I have the
                            impression that the Soviet Union and the United States consider that
                            problems can be solved only through understandings between the two of
                            them. This could mean there might be repeated the situation that existed
                            on the eve of the Second World War. History demonstrates that this sort
                            or solution isn't valid.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No. I think
                            that that's what the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> believes. Our
                            thinking is more complicated.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: In any case,
                            in order for the problems of Europe to be solved, to achieve security on
                            the continent, new concepts, new actions, are necessary. I'm going to
                            say something to you about some thoughts which we will be debating at
                            our Congress. You've come before the Congress. I'd like to outline them
                            for you.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: When is the
                            Congress?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: November 25.
                            The first problem is how does one achieve some real military disarmament
                            in Europe and reduction of troops which are concentrated here. What's
                            being discussed in Vienna we consider as having no value at all.</p>
                        <pb n="16" xml:id="d31-16" facs="d31-16"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Agreed.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I wanted to
                            tell you that we are debating, though we haven't taken any decision,
                            what advantage there is for us to participate even in the role of
                            observer. We consider that it really is necessary to approach these
                            problems with new concepts, with a new spirit, these problems of
                            concentration military forces and armaments in Europe. It's something
                            unheard of in modern times that thirty years after a war a peace treaty
                            should not have been concluded and for that matter no one is even
                            considering one. Basically Europe is living in a state of armistice, the
                            armistice signed at Potsdam. So the second problem that raises is that
                            of eliminating this provisional statement of things and all that's
                            connected with it, doing away with any traces of the state of war and
                            any rights that flow therefrom. This presupposes the withdrawal of
                            troops from the territories of other states and all that is connected
                            therewith. It's in this light that we judge this general European
                            security conference and why we consider that this is not a moment for
                            ending things but rather for a beginning of moving toward the final
                            solution at these problems.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I've already
                            explained to the Foreign Minister that so far as the Geneva conference
                            is concerned we were not among its early champions but this is not the
                            principal reason for its moving slowly. We're willing to bring it to a
                            reasonable conclusion. I think by early spring this is accomplishable.
                            There has not yet been agreement on the level of which the conference
                            should end. Everybody says it depends on the outcome but the outcome is
                            perfectly foreseeable. It is my personal conviction that it end at the
                            highest level. This is my personal, not an official, view but before
                            this happens foreign offices will fill up <pb n="17" xml:id="d31-17"
                                facs="d31-17"/>hundreds of file cabinets on the subject but this is
                            not the basic question.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: In any case,
                            our main concern is not the level of the meeting but with what sorts of
                            things we will come to the conference.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand
                            that in the first basket the issues concern the peaceful change of
                            frontiers and if every principle has equal validity or rather if each is
                            to be implemented with equal strictness. These are solvable because
                            nobody understands them. I won't review all the other issues. It would
                            take all night. The big issues are in baskets 3 and 4. I think we will
                            come to the conference with something reasonable still at the end I
                            don't believe it will mark a turning point in history.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: You see I too
                            believe the principal problem will be solved. I think this is valid for
                            the economic ones and even for the so-called third basket of
                            humanitarian problems. The main problem, though, has to do with measures
                            of a military nature designed to prevent a new situation of tension, and
                            equally with the creation of an organization of a consultative nature -
                            I'm not raising the question of any particular format which could assure
                            some continuity for discussing the problems which remain to be
                            solved.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have
                            agreed that our Ambassadors in Geneva would be in touch on this subject.
                            I want to be quite frank. Our concern is exactly the opposite of yours.
                            In my judgment you want to prevent by means of some general system of
                            organization a superpower from interfering in state relations in Eastern
                            Europe and for that such a mechanism would be very useful. We want to
                            prevent that same superpower from <pb n="18" xml:id="d31-18"
                                facs="d31-18"/>increasing its influence within Western Europe and
                            for that such a mechanism has certain dangers.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: It depends on
                            how it would be organized.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: For that
                            reason we have suggested getting together. We have not taken a final
                            position. We will look at your ideas of a mechanism with an open
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: We realize
                            that the United States is an important factor in Europe and we hope that
                            it will take on certain further responsibilities. It would be a positive
                            thing if they were in the direction of achieving a new climate of
                            political security in Europe and for that matter new economic
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We will have
                            to look realistically at what you have in mind and give our candid
                            comment. On the military discussions I think that those that are taking
                            place in Vienna are not useful at this point and we think that the
                            Soviet Union doesn't want any progress now. That's our impression.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: In any case
                            problems in Europe are ones we consider extremely complicated and
                            consider the dangers very great, dangers which could lead at any time to
                            complications like Cyprus, with implications that are extensive and
                            difficult to foresee.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We are
                            prepared to stabilize the situation and make it more secure.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I realize that
                            there isn't enough time to discuss all this now. I raised these
                            questions from a desire that we should reflect on them and on the
                            solutions which might be called for.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It would be
                            interesting to have your ideas <pb n="19" xml:id="d31-19" facs="d31-19"
                            />on how to move things toward a peace settlement and a general idea of
                            what it would contain.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: What all peace
                            treaties contain, elimination of the state of war with all the
                            consequences that flow therefrom. There are even problems with the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter which are tied to the
                            state of war and which need to be solved. I'm not referring to the right
                            of veto. This isn't a current problem, but in the Charter there are
                            certain provisions which provide for the rift of intervention in the
                            affairs of other states.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You want to
                            prevent this?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I think the
                            whole world does.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Tell me, are
                            you an enemy state of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>? I know
                            you are an ally.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Legally no,
                            but Article 53 allows for intervention in the affairs of former enemy
                            states and any interpretation could be given to this article.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I see now
                            what you have in mind.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: It's not a
                            question only of Romania. This is something unique in history to provide
                            for and continue to maintain the right, derived from a state of war, to
                            intervene whenever one wanted in the affairs of others.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I see your
                            point of view very well.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Therefore a
                            treaty of peace presupposes a sort of regulating, a sort of eliminating
                            of these anomalies and leftover situations.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I personally
                            think that a peace treaty, if it includes Germany, would be very
                            difficult to negotiate but I see no reason why one couldn't be with
                            other states.</p>
                        <pb n="20" xml:id="d31-20" facs="d31-20"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: We have a
                            treaty or peace signed in Paris in 1946. I'm not raising any questions
                            as far as Romania is concerned. But we didn't want the same thing to
                            happen as in the story about the lamb and the wolf.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: No. I know
                            what you have in mind but I personally think that a peace treaty with
                            Germany is very difficult because of the conditions and mentality in
                            both parts. I told <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> that
                            the greatest danger would be if the German Democratic Republic won the
                            European football championship. He didn't completely disagree with me.
                            Their self-confidence would have acquired unmanageable proportions. In
                            addition, they play football as if it represented the philosophy of
                            Kant, very methodically.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: You know the
                            Germans very well.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: True. We'd
                            like to ease military confrontation in Central Europe, anywhere in
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Certainly, you
                            see, the problem deserves discussion in more detailed fashion, because
                            the United States, in assuming certain responsibilities, is thereby
                            affected much more by all the states in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I understand
                            very well what you are saying and it is an important point and frankly I
                            had not considered it in the rather subtle way you have put it here.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I'd like to
                            pursue what I have begun. To go along with the idea that problems can be
                            solved between just two countries is something which will lead to
                            failure. I appreciate the role of the United States and of the Soviet
                            Union and I have said this to <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> and other Soviet leaders. But I also appreciate
                            the fact that even based on this role problems simply cannot be solved
                                <pb n="21" xml:id="d31-21" facs="d31-21"/>without taking into
                            consideration the interests of others.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We don't rely
                            on this role in the United States.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: You remember
                            how it was in 1939. Stalin and Hitler had signed an agreement which was
                            to last for a thousand years. You know how long it lasted and what the
                            results were. I know that the United States can't be compared with
                            Hitler's Germany. Yet understandings between just two countries are
                            opposed by all of Europe, including your closest allies.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Why, so they
                            can make them themselves?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Perhaps they
                            are impelled by the way the United States acts. I say this without
                            denying that some might want to make agreements themselves.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Do you think
                            French policy has anything to do with what we do? We have made every
                            effort with them.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: As far as
                            French policy is concerned, no, but in any case I consider it somewhat
                            more realistic than the policies of others.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In Europe or
                            with the United States?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Europe. The
                            danger doesn't come from France.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But -</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: It's still a
                            problem however in that one can arrive at an accentuation of the
                            division of Europe, perhaps without the United States even wanting to
                            contribute to this sort of thing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: How?</p>
                        <pb n="22" xml:id="d31-22" facs="d31-22"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I am speaking
                            not just as a President with the Secretary of State of the United States
                            but as a statesman with another statesman who needs to have an
                            understanding of more general factors, irrespective of the specific
                            responsibilities he may have at any time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree with
                            the necessity of looking at historical trends and not just at daily
                            symptoms. I believe also that the problems of Europe are much more
                            complicated than most Americans understand, but what concrete steps at
                            any one time one can take is a difficult question.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: One of the
                            concrete steps is connected with the European Security Conference,
                            namely to write into the documents from a political point of view the
                            necessary provisions to open up ways for solving problems. I personally
                            am not someone who has illusions about the durability of agreements.
                            They remain effective only for so long as they are based on a certain
                            correlation of forces. They can, however, play a role, they can help. We
                            therefore consider that these conference documents should be as clear as
                            possible. From this point of view I believe that you remember the
                            discussions we had five years ago in this very room when talked about
                            the fact that great changes would be coming soon. They have come on a
                            much larger scale and much more rapidly than we expected and I don't
                            think everyone is prepared for this or understands them as they
                            should.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have a
                            number of problems we have to deal with in the West. The only country
                            that can deal with them is our own. We have to maintain a constant
                            dialogue with the Soviets on nuclear weapons. Otherwise the danger is
                            too great for both sides. That is evident. We have to try to do
                            something about the problem of energy. If we don't take the leadership
                            it could lead to such political <pb n="23" xml:id="d31-23" facs="d31-23"
                            />weakening of the West that the whole structure of the post-war period
                            would disintegrate. So this creates a certain perspective, but we don't
                            believe we can solve all these problems only with the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and we need in Europe a sense of
                            national consciousness. If the United States attempts to deal with every
                            problem in every part of the world on our own we will be exhausted. We
                            want Europe to have a great ability to deal with problems itself. It's
                            necessary for our own well-being.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I have
                            confidence in Europe. Certainly there are complicated problems but they
                            can and must be solved. Both the United States and the Soviet Union can
                            make an important contribution to the extent that they both remain aware
                            of the aspirations of the other peoples of Europe.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Let me tell
                            you first of all I understand your concern. Let me say then something
                            indirectly. I studied the foreign policy of Bismarck when I was a
                            professor. When you look at the situation within Germany at that time,
                            one country was somewhat more aggressive, Prussia, and another less
                            aggressive, which was Austria. And all the small German states looked to
                            Austria for protection. In 1864 Bismarck convinced Austria that the
                            small German states were nuisance and interfered with solutions to
                            problems, that these problems should be settled directly between Prussia
                            and Austria without reference to the all states. Austria accepted this
                            idea. All the small German states were dismayed. Two years later Prussia
                            attacked Austria which had totally isolated itself. So one can sometimes
                            learn from history.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Let's hope
                            so.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: There will be
                            no condominium while I'm <pb n="24" xml:id="d31-24" facs="d31-24"
                            />Secretary of State. We are not children. We know what their strategy
                            is and what after all have we actually done compared to what we say that
                            leads toward condominium?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I think we've
                            discussed a fair amount about Europe. I, in any case, want to repeat my
                            hope -- that the United States at the conference will have as
                            constructive a position as possible and in general that it win be active
                            in carrying out the responsibilities it has assumed for solving the
                            problems at European security and peace.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: After talks
                            with your representatives we became somewhat more active at the European
                            Security Conference. I can tell you confidentially we intend to be more
                            active. We will speak seriously to the German Chancellor when he comes
                            to the United States in December. So I think I've understood your
                            fundamental position about the American role in Europe.</p>

                        <p>MEMORANDUM FOR: THE PRESIDENT</p>
                        <p>Romania is anxious to secure most-favored nation tariff treatment when
                            the Trade Reform Act is passed. To minimize any delay and also to
                            demonstrate our positive intent to the Romanians, I would like to begin
                            negotiations on a trade agreement now.</p>
                        <p>I propose that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHGJ1">Barnes</persName>
                            conduct the negotiations in Bucharest, assisted by a small staff-level
                            group from agencies represented on the Committee on East-West Trade
                            Policy.</p>
                        <p>The trade agreement would have features similar to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> trade agreement including, in
                            addition to <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>, provisions covering

                            businessmen, and a projection of trade levels.</p>
                        <p>It will be important to advise key Congressional figures of our plans to
                            undertake negotiations with the Romanians in advance of the necessary
                            legislative authority. There is considerable support on the Hill for
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> for Romania and Congress will,
                            under the Trade Reform Act, have an opportunity to review the agreement.
                            Moreover, consultations will help avoid any adverse impact on prospects
                            for the trade bill.</p>
                        <p>I recommend that you authorize the opening of negotiations with Romania
                            in early December in Bucharest.</p>

                            particularly nice of you to stop so we could have this opportunity to
                            discuss matters of mutual interest on your way back to Romania after
                            your trip to Latin America.</p>

                            be positive results from it.</p>
                        <p>President: I do want to thank you for sending an emissary right after I
                            became President. It happened rather suddenly and I appreciated your
                            gesture.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Since this is our first
                            meeting after you became President I want to extend to you my most
                            sincere congratulations. I hope you occupy this post for a long period
                            of time. I have heard that you will be a candidate next year, and I hope
                            that we will be able to continue our collaboration in the period that
                            follows.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>President: Thank you. I will be a candidate. I think we will win so I
                            look forward to working with you in the future. I am most anxious that
                            we, during my Presidency, expand the relations established by the U.
                            S.-Romanian Declaration of 1973.</p>
                        <p>We are of course most anxious, Mr. President, to implement the Trade
                            Agreement between Romania and the United States. I have submitted the
                            necessary documents to the Congress to get Congress to take the action
                            which would bring about the benefits of the Trade Agreement which are
                            important to the United States and to Romania and to our relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Of course we await with
                            great interest the entry into force of this Agreement. I can guarantee
                            to you there will be no opposition to it in Romania, and I hope that it
                            will be approved in the United States as well. We would want the results
                            of our good economic collaboration over the past four years to continue,
                            and if this agreement will come into force would expect our two-way
                            trade to reach a billion dollars.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The President is
                            meeting with some Congressional people this afternoon and also with some
                            Jewish leaders.</p>
                        <p>President: If I might make a suggestion, but first let me comment. We are
                            most anxious that Congress approve this Agreement which we submitted on
                            April 24. They have until July to take the necessary action. We do want
                                <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> for Romania. We want
                            Export-Import Bank credits and trade benefits for Romania. I think I
                            have to be very frank and say that the Congressmen will probably raise
                            difficult questions with you, as they have with our own people.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d34-03" facs="d34-03"/>
                        <p>They are very interested in Jewish emigration to Israel and the United
                            States. We of course disapprove of that requirement in the law. We think
                            it is unnecessary, but it is the law and we must go through these
                            procedures. The way to get favorable action by Congress is to get some
                            evidence that there is some increase in emigration to Israel and to the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I will be very frank.
                            As far as the United States is concerned, there is no problem. There are
                            still some humanitarian cases. We will solve these as we have been
                            solving others.</p>
                        <p>As far as Israel is concerned, there are not very many Romanian citizens
                            left who are of Jewish nationality. The great majority of these are
                            married to Romanians. Therefore the problem is that it is not likely
                            that a substantial emigration will continue.</p>
                        <p>In the last four years 18, 000 people applied. And there were a couple
                            thousand more who applied in the years just before that. 18, 300 have
                            left. Right now there are still about 2, 000 who have been approved,
                            some of them as much as two years ago. But with the tension in the area
                            and the war, although they have approval to depart in their pocket, they
                            have given up the idea or put off their departure. Therefore, in this
                            instance too there is no longer a major problem. We will try to solve
                            those cases that remain favorably.</p>
                        <p>As a matter of face we have now a fairly large number of cases of those
                            who want to return to Israel and we haven't been able to find a solution
                            to this situation yet.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed these questions already with Deputy Prime Minister Allon
                            and at his time of departure he made a favorable declaration. He even
                            met with the Chief Rabbi.</p>
                        <p>President: This is very encouraging, Mr. President. I just believe it is
                            very important that you are able to provide this information, this
                            factual data, to the Congressional people and to the Jewish leaders
                            because they could hamstring and make it difficult for us to get the

                        <p>President: I know you are concerned about the European Security
                            Conference and about the problems that held up the agreement. We of
                            course have had some reservations about Baskets I and III. I would
                            appreciate hearing your own appreciation about the prospects and what
                            you anticipate.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: First of all, I would
                            like to come back to some bilateral questions in connection with your
                            forthcoming visit to Romania.</p>
                        <p>Aside from the problem of this Agreement which I hope will be adopted by
                            the Congress, perhaps it would be well on the occasion of your visit to
                            Romania to resolve other problems also. I previously raised the question
                            of concluding a long-term economic cooperation agreement and had also
                            raised the matter of granting Romania the special conditions of trade
                            given to developing countries. I do not want to get into a discussion
                            now, and do not insist on an answer now, but in connection with your
                            visit I would hope to be able to solve these problems, to give your
                            visit to Romania concrete content. I had previously extended an
                            invitation for you to visit Romania, to be sure, but I wanted to use
                            this occasion to make the invitation personal.</p>
                        <p>President: Mr. President, I appreciate your personally delivering the
                            invitation to come to Romania. There is a distinct possibility and I
                            would like to do it. If there is a European Security Conference Meeting
                            in July or August it might be possible to stop for a visit in Romania
                            after the conference in Helsinki.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Mr. President, on the
                            question of long-term cooperation, we have discussed this previously and
                            agreed on it in principle and we can announce it at any point you
                            consider desirable. Our plans have been to get <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss> through Congress first without any extraneous debate,
                            so this would fit in with the schedule you are discussing.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d34-05" facs="d34-05"/>
                        <p>President: If the European Security Conference is in late July and
                            Congress would act on the Trade Agreement for Romania by August 1.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_BHGJ1">Barnes</persName>: It could come out of
                            committee by July 15, but they may not take action until early September
                            because they have 60 legislative days and the August recess may
                            intervene.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You do not have to
                            link these two things that closely for your visit.</p>
                        <p>President: But it would be helpful to get the Trade Agreement done and
                            not have it complicated by any announcement. This reinforces the need to
                            get favorable consideration and action before the Congressional
                            recess.</p>
                        <p>Otherwise there will be five weeks delay. So it is important to get
                            Congress to act, preferably prior to the visit, and then we could
                            announce we would be having a long-term agreement.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: As far as European
                            Security is concerned, we are concerned not so much by the fact of delay
                            as by the content and expected results of the Conference. For us, it is
                            not a problem of the dates, but of the results of this Conference. Of
                            course, if it can take place in July, that is fine, or if it is in
                            August or even September, that is fine. The principal thing is to get
                            results which will contribute to the strengthening of confidence and
                            will enhance detente. Therefore, it is not Basket III which is
                            essential, the question of now many journalists or artists travel. That
                            is for the experts. This isn't what is so essential. As far as we are
                            concerned, let as many as want travel around. The essential problems are
                            in the first Basket. On this hangs the movement toward detente and for
                            that matter the conditions of things like cultural exchanges.</p>
                        <p>In connection with this we see some problems which must be solved if the
                            Conference is going to wind up with good results. First of all there
                            should be firm engagements of states on the renunciation of force and
                            noninterference in the internal affairs of other states. Secondly, there
                            is the problem of certain military aspects. Granted it is not a question
                            of resolving basic problems, but we have sought nonetheless to make sure
                            that there will not be interference in the internal affairs of other
                            states. It is a question for example, of these engagements regarding
                            military maneuvers. And even here it is not so much whether it will be
                            250 or 180 kilometers or 10 to 20 thousand men, but the very fact that
                            the content of these measures should be obligatory and not something
                            voluntary. Therefore if all these problems <pb n="6" xml:id="d34-06"
                                facs="d34-06"/>are going to be reduced to something voluntary, it no
                            longer makes any sense to waste time and energy over 100 kilometers of
                            distance here and there. But what we are doing is introducing into
                            international law certain rules which have existed up to now. When a
                            group of states arrives at certain understandings, these would be
                            mandatory and not voluntary. That is important.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MG4">Macovescu</persName>: One of the other
                            principal problems is that connected with continuity of the Conference,
                            the follow-up.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I don't know what your
                            opinion is but we believe the most dangerous situation is still in
                            Europe where there are the two military blocs with modern armaments,
                            huge concentrations of troops, atomic weapons as well. Therefore we
                            would want to have the summit meeting represent not the conclusion but
                            rather the beginning of European security. For this reason we are in
                            favor of an organism, a process for assuring the continuity of this
                            conference.</p>
                        <p>President: How often do you see it meeting? Every year, every two
                            years?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Once a year, once in
                            two years, any time when it is necessary. If there should appear some
                            tense situation, if something should happen, then it could discuss what
                            might be done to prevent things getting worse.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What do you think of
                            the idea of a review conference in 18 months or two years?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: In our opinion that is
                            a good idea. We think as a matter of fact that this sort of permanent
                            organism could have the role of preparing such a conference. I don't
                            have in mind something that would be set up with a lot of bureaucracy,
                            but rather something that would meet periodically once a year or every
                            six months. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of one of the countries
                            would have the role of coordinator, and this could be on a rotational
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: For example,

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We have explained to
                            Romania and we have been in close touch with the Romanian delegation to
                            the Conference, that the very reason Romania wants this is why we are
                            not agreeable. We are not eager to grant to <pb n="7" xml:id="d34-07"
                                facs="d34-07"/>countries the right of permanent interference in the
                            West. Quite frankly, this is the problem with a permanent mechanism. I
                            understand why you want something to which you could appeal, but we do
                            not want established structures in the West to be exploited. We are
                            sympathetic, though, to your concerns.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: We don't think of this
                            organism as having any sort of right to do this, and in order to avoid
                            this problem we could regulate the basis on which it would act to
                            exclude such possible intervention. We see it as preparing for new
                            conferences and for solving such problems as will appear. We don't want
                            any Eastern intervention in the West or Western intervention in the East
                            or Western intervention in the West or Eastern intervention in the East.
                            I would ask you to reflect scene more on this problem and to review your
                            position.</p>

                                expected” on seeking military sales from the United States and
                                recommended waiting until President Ford's visit for a fuller

                        <p>(While the photographers were still taking pictures, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> said to President <persName

                            come to the United States again on an occasion when it wouldn't be
                            necessary just to work but when he would also have time to relax.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> replied that
                            he would like very much to be able to do that.)</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: As we said before,
                            we are overjoyed with the opportunity to expand our trade. It is of
                            great benefit for each country and you have been very helpful.</p>
                        <p>President: I should like to wish you once more a warm welcome to Romania
                            and I consider that the relations between our countries have indeed
                            developed very well and through the entry into force of the commercial
                            accord our trade will increase considerably more. As a matter of fact,
                            we have now a number of agreements, a good legal framework, and a good
                            spirit. I have received tens of telegrams from heads of American firms
                            and for that matter from Members of Congress expressing their
                            satisfaction with the entry into force of the commercial agreement.</p>
                        <p>Of course the essence of the problem from now on is for Romanian
                            enterprises and American firms to act in such a way as to take advantage
                            of this agreement which provides a good legal base. So far as the <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="d36-02" facs="d36-02"/>governments are concerned, a
                            lot has been accomplished. There are, to be sure, some other matters
                            which can be settled in the future. Some as a matter of fact are rather
                            more on the unilateral side as far as the United States is concerned, as
                            for example, the granting of generalized preferences. We can't of course
                            grant such preferences to the United States. Secondly, in principle we
                            have already agreed on a long term economic cooperation agreement.</p>
                        <p>Then too we should encourage the reaching of agreements in scientific and
                            cultural fields which are already under study or in same cases actually
                            being negotiated.</p>
                        <p>I want to tell you that in my view we have indeed reached a whole range
                            of agreements and with the entry into force of the trade agreement we
                            have created extremely good conditions, conditions which are very
                            advantageous for us both. As a matter of fact, as I was saying to some
                            of my colleagues today, we've got to the point where we really don't
                            have anything much to ask the United States for now on a bilateral
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: We only ask for
                            your friendship, Mr. President, and your leadership in helping to carry
                            out the agreements we concluded yesterday in Helsinki.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: On the matter
                            of the long term agreement, Mr. President, we had held up on this so
                            there would be no confusion in Congress with <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss>. Now that it has passed there's no difficulty with the
                            long term economic agreement on which we have agreed in principle.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: So we can
                            finish off these bilateral problems, I hope that in the framework of
                            these good relations we can work, taking into account the situation of
                            Romania as a developing country, both in the area to which I have
                            referred as well as that of credits, in the latter respect of course
                            within the framework of existing American legislation.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d36-03" facs="d36-03"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: Are you speaking
                            of Ex-Im or other financial institutions?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: It seems to me
                            that as far as Ex-Im is concerned things have been more or less
                            clarified.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I am really
                            thinking of the American practice, which is not at all a bad one, of
                            granting long term low interest credits.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: You're
                            speaking-then of those for under-developed countries.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Concessional
                            loans. That is something linked to Romania's stage of development. We
                            have looked into this before and found that it has always been difficult
                            to arrange. There are Members of Congress who would in all likelihood
                            want to deny credits on the grounds that Romania is not at a stage of
                            under-development for which development loans were designed. We can
                            support Romania in the World Bank and can encourage the Ex-Im Bank and
                            can also encourage private investment but that of course is not on
                            concessional terms.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: Are there any
                            American banks operating in Romania such as Chase?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We arranged a
                            loan three or four years ago for Romania through David Rockefeller.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I think that
                            perhaps we might be able to be successful once more with Congress if
                            this credit question were raised in such a way as to be tied in with
                            some specific objectives, say something in agriculture, land
                            reclamation, prevention of floods, navigation, irrigation, some direct
                            connections, not just general untied loans. Something that would be
                            accomplished through tying to some concrete actions.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Now that the
                            President has handled Senator <pb n="4" xml:id="d36-04" facs="d36-04"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JHM1">Jackson</persName> so successfully, he's
                            ready to take on the Congress again. He really treated you as terribly
                            as he has treated us.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: In fact he has
                            said nicer things about you than about me.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I told him
                            with the sort of speeches he was making he could hardly be a successful
                            candidate for President. Perhaps this helped.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We can look
                            at the agriculture development aspect.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: Are you thinking
                            of agricultural equipment like combines, something to spur
                            production?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Irrigation,
                            land reclamation, drainage, flood control.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: This kind of
                            project would seem to be more than anything else likely for the World
                            Bank.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We now have
                            in our aid activities a program that seeks to promote agricultural
                            development but we have never considered that for Romania.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: We'll look into
                            it.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: As for the
                            rest, we'll do everything to have the best possible results so that we
                            can assure extension of our cooperation to the widest possible extent in
                            the economic field.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Our general
                            policy, Mr. President, is to keep Romania two steps ahead of other
                            Eastern European countries in our relations. Many Eastern European
                            countries came to us at Helsinki with proposals to improve their
                            relations with us. It is up to you to make suggestions regarding
                            maintaining Romania's relations with us so they stay ahead. You can make
                            suggestions through our excellent ambassador here or yours in
                            Washington. Of course the Foreign Minister may well come to New York
                            this fall and make an anti-<pb n="5" xml:id="d36-05" facs="d36-05"
                            />imperialist speech and then he'll probably come around and get in
                            touch with me and make some suggestions for doing something for
                            Romania.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: But you have
                            spoken in favor of getting rid of the old state of things and
                            instituting a new order.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's
                            correct.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: I probably had
                            more heads of government at Helsinki who talked to me from the East than
                            from the West.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: This means
                            that you have an advantageous position in the East. In any case it's no
                            reason for you to be annoyed when people start talking in an
                            anti-imperialist way since these are questions which have a larger
                            applicability.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Having
                            Romania in the United Nations is not our biggest problem.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: When we are on the
                            train trip tomorrow, which we are looking forward to, we ought to have
                            an opportunity to discuss problems other than those brought up
                            today.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Of course. As
                            far as European problems are concerned there was so much talk at
                            Helsinki that any other words now wouldn't have all that much
                            importance. What is important will be to see what can be accomplished,
                            what each country will do to carry out what was declared and signed.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: I have the
                            impression, though I may be overoptimistic, that there will be honest
                            efforts to live up to these words. After all, in two years there will be
                            the periodic accounting. I think you'll see done what was promised.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I'm by nature
                            an optimist but this time I'm not really all that optimistic. The
                            problems which need to be solved are very serious ones and they require
                            solutions, some of <pb n="6" xml:id="d36-06" facs="d36-06"/>which go
                            beyond by a great deal what was signed in Helsinki. To be sure, if I
                            were to mention economic problems but we can discuss them later. Rather,
                            with regard to some of the other problems concerning Europe, they are
                            really quite serious. Of course have already had the occasion to touch
                            on some of these with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> but I would like to use this possibility to
                            share with you a few of my thoughts if you are agreeable.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: Please.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: In the first
                            place, 30 years after the war Europe is still living under armistice
                            conditions. The document we signed at Helsinki and for that matter some
                            of the statements made there were intended to say we should continue to
                            live in the spirit of the Potsdam Agreement until peace is concluded.
                            This of course implies that those who were victorious in the war, and
                            this has to do with all the rights regarding Berlin, have the right to
                            intervene in places where there is no peace treaty at any time they feel
                            like it. There are of course certain understandable rights but there are
                            also very great risks. I don't think it's a secret from anyone that
                            there are very few Germans who approve of this state of things or are in
                            any way enthusiastic about this situation. Hitler as you know came to
                            power thanks to the situation which was created for Germany as a result
                            of the first World War.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: That's right.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: There is a
                            certain existing situation, there is a certain correlation of forces now
                            on a worldwide scale, but this situation will not be eternal nor in my
                            opinion will even last that long. Of course I'm not saying anything new
                            to Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. What I'm
                            telling you now is that although there is a very clear situation today
                            where the United States and the Soviet Union both control the major
                            military forces including nuclear armaments, <pb n="7" xml:id="d36-07"
                                facs="d36-07"/>even that situation is not immutable. Anyway, in
                            order to solve this problem, to do away with this situation, to achieve
                            a peace treaty, requires putting every state involved on an equal
                            footing including Germany. This it seems to me is one of the problems
                            which it will be essential to be solved for the future of Europe. You
                            know in recent years how quickly many situations have changed with what
                            great rapidity.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: Would you suggest
                            that these problems be solved on a bilateral or broader basis?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: To be sure, in
                            the first instance they need to be solved by the four powers and the
                            Germans themselves because first of all the four powers are tied in by
                            the Potsdam treaty with the situation in Germany proper.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Could I ask
                            the President what problems worry you most in Europe. You were saying
                            just now the situation might change.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: You know very
                            well some of the changes that have taken place even in Europe in the
                            relative positions of different states. To continue to live under the
                            aegis of the Potsdam treaty means the risk of intervention at any
                            moment. This is the essential problem.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You would
                            like a solution to the German problem.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: Unification?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Yes. But now a
                            treaty of peace.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: A peace
                            treaty for Germany?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Getting rid of
                            the Potsdam status and the achievement of a normal state of affairs in
                            Europe which would exclude such a right of intervention in the internal
                            affairs of other states.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What about
                            with regard to Berlin?</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d36-08" facs="d36-08"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: In the context
                            of a peace treaty a solution would have to be found for Berlin. So long
                            as this will depend on the good will of the four powers any one of which
                            could take the initiative to intervene whenever it believed it was
                            entitled to do so. I note that many others as well as you yourself
                            mentioned in their declarations at Helsinki that they agreed with the
                            right of assigning a special status in Germany and Berlin to the four
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We made
                            them.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: It seems to me
                            others did as well.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Without a
                            doubt preservation of this state of affairs means maintaining a
                            permanent lack of security and constant danger of tension in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: What terms
                            would be in such a treaty?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: It's difficult
                            to say now what provisions there might be. In the first place, one has
                            to arrive at the realistic conclusion that it is time to put an end to
                            this sort of situation. The peace treaty should do away with any sort of
                            rights of some states over other states. Granted I'm not talking about
                            the Leninist slogan of no annexations or reparations. That belongs to
                            the past. But a peace, even with reparations and territorial changes,
                            that would still be just.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In the
                            humanist tradition?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I prefer to
                            say the realist tradition.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I wanted to
                            ask the President what he thinks will happen to <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>. That is if <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> is mortal. I'm not saying this as
                            a fact but as an hypothesis.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: To be sure,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> has given his own
                            answer to this question several months ago. Yugoslavia has enough
                            political strength to assure the necessary continuity.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d36-09" facs="d36-09"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: Don't you think
                            there might be foreign intervention?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I think that
                            what was signed at Helsinki will exclude any type of intervention.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: But the Soviets
                            have that habit already.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I think that
                            any direct intervention is hardly conceivable. It would meet extremely
                            strong resistance. No one would accept this sort of thing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But might not
                            one side ask for outside intervention?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: Is there a force
                            strong enough to have continuity of a national government?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I think that
                            there exists the force to assure this. A trial of strength couldn't
                            succeed and so this can hardly be envisaged. Granted there are different
                            ways of influencing things both economic and political.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We give great
                            importance to the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and its
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: I thought that
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> looked extremely
                            well.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He's 83.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>. Of course I
                            believe that it's necessary that Yugoslavia maintain its independence
                            and unity and that settlement of its problems with its neighbors be
                            assured in order to avoid any kind of tension between them.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: Do Romania and
                            Yugoslavia have any serious political problems?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: No, we have
                            extremely good relations. No problems at all. They have some problems
                            with the Italians. It would be indeed very good if they could reach some
                            agreement in order to improve the state of things.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d36-10" facs="d36-10"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Italian
                            army is not really the most terrifying in Europe.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: I gather, Mr.
                            President, that is I have the impression that you were using the
                            Yugoslav problem or situation as an illustration as to how there might
                            be prevention of intervention from outside forces when internal problems
                            take place.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Yes,
                            Yugoslavia and other countries in Europe. But to come back to the
                            Germany problem, maintaining the present situation can justify any kind
                            of intervention. The Turks, for example, based their intervention in
                            Cyprus on the 1956 agreement through which the situation in Cyprus was
                            supposedly guaranteed. I know that this question (of rights of
                            intervention) is often discussed there in the United States but I
                            believe that a review of your position will bring you to the conclusion
                            that more needs to be done for achieving peace in Europe, that United
                            States Interests will not be adversely affected.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: We would welcome
                            real peace in Europe.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I think I
                            understand what you are getting at and why you do not favor anything
                            like this for the use of the superpowers. As for us, we will not make
                            use of the right to intervene. Still, it's difficult now to arrange
                            something, speaking frankly, which would not lead to our withdrawal from
                            Europe, whereby the freedom of European countries will not be affected.
                            Many of our arrangements depend on transit rights to East Germany. I
                            understand what you are after but it is hard to arrange.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: You have raised,
                            Mr. President, as I interpret it, a very serious, very fundamental
                            problem that has broad implications. I would like to talk to the
                            Secretary tonight or tomorrow and maybe continue our discussions because
                            I feel they are extremely important. I would <pb n="11" xml:id="d36-11"
                                facs="d36-11"/>like to understand this more clearly and get the
                            Secretary's observations before we get another opportunity to talk about
                            this.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Of course, I
                            just wanted to mention while raising these questions I didn't have in
                            mind a ready-made solution that would be too hasty. Still, over the next
                            one or two years it is a problem that must find some solution. It's a
                            problem about which we need to think a lot. It could happen that we
                            would be caught by surprise without any solutions or even any ideas.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's right.
                            We should not be taken by surprise.</p>
                        <p>(The group all rose at this point and moved toward the exit.)</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: We need to have as
                            many alternatives as possible.</p>

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> began by saying
                            that after the <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss> conference it was
                            necessary to think about what problems needed to be tackled next. In his
                            opinion, disarmament was such a problem. The President asked what
                            opinion President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> had
                            about the <gloss target="#t_MBFR1">MBFR</gloss> talks, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said “not much.” The
                            sorts of reductions being discussed, on the order of 20-30,000, were of
                            a kind which could be achieved just as well through more efficient
                            organization of any army. In addition, it wasn't really a question of
                            numbers of soldiers, but rather of armaments, fire power, and in the
                            first instance the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. To take an abstract example, even
                            with numbers, it wasn't right for reductions to be applied across the
                            board, with Romania and Holland being subjected say to the same 10%
                            reductions that would apply to the Soviets and Americans. The Secretary
                            asked why this wasn't fair, and President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> replied that for the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> this meant 200,000 troops and for the Soviets 300,000,
                            but it still left their basic strength intact. The Secretary asked what
                            10% would mean for Romania, to which President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> replied in the order of
                            20,000. The element of fire power was what counted anyway. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> asked if what really
                            bothered Romania wasn't 10% but what would happen when things got to 50%
                            or 60%. This is exactly right, President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> said, and then went on to say that what
                            counted, so far as troops were concerned, was not a transfer from say
                            Czechoslovakia to Hungary of a couple thousand men but withdrawals. The
                            Secretary said he wondered whether Romania really <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d37-02" facs="d37-02"/>wanted <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> troop withdrawals given the fact that the continued
                            presence of American troops in Europe was useful for preserving
                            equilibrium on the continent from the standpoint of Romania and in
                            particular Yugoslavia. President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> said he wasn't talking about <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> troop withdrawals but about real
                            reductions which should be balanced and under adequate control. What was
                            needed was a mechanism for ensuring both reductions and control. As a
                            matter of fact, he noted, the Chinese have done more than anybody else
                            to bring about troop reductions in Europe by obliging the Soviets to
                            move substantial troops to the Chinese border. The Secretary recalled
                            that there are about 44 Soviet divisions there now and that whenever he
                            mentions their “northern” ally to the Chinese, they tremble, not from
                            fear of course.</p>
                        <p>Returning to the subject of disarmament, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said that one error that some
                            countries, including the United States, make at times is to ignore the
                            role of small less developed states. So long as the major nuclear powers
                            make no real steps toward nuclear disarmament, the danger exists and
                            will increase that any number of smaller countries will try to acquire
                            nuclear weapons - countries in the Middle East, Asia or even Latin
                            America like Brazil. The Secretary noted that the Indians may be in that
                            category though they are so very moral and pacifistic. They're not all
                            that pacifistic, replied President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName>. In any event, these same countries could also
                            develop chemical or biological weapons which are cheaper and may well be
                            more destructive.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> then brought
                            the conversation back to Europe and remarked that he would be involved
                            before long in what would in effect be a follow-up conference to <gloss
                                target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss> - the conference of European
                            communist parties. It could well turn out to be even more important than
                                <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss> itself because at it would be
                            decided whether a communist party in say Italy or France could have its
                            own policies or would have to take orders from outside. The President
                            asked what attitude President Ceausescu thought such parties would take.
                            He replied that the Italian and Spanish parties, from all he knew of
                            their leadership, would not accept outside dictation. With regard to the
                            Portuguese party, President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> observed it was hard to say, but the military
                            leaders he had met, including President Costa Gomes, were definitely
                            committed to a policy of independence. In response to the secretary's
                            where and when the conference would take place, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said probably in November and
                            probably in Berlin. (After the conversation broke up Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BHGJ1">Barnes</persName> asked President <pb
                                n="3" xml:id="d37-03" facs="d37-03"/>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> whether he really
                            thought agreement could ever be reached on a document to be submitted to
                            the conference. President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> replied that eventually there would be one on
                            the same consensus basis as used at Geneva for <gloss target="#t_CSCE1"
                                >CSCE</gloss>. In any case, he was not looking forward with any
                            great enthusiasm to this conference but Romania would definitely
                            participate.)</p>
                        <p>Prior to that will be the <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> (<gloss
                                target="#t_COMECON1">COMECON</gloss>) summit conference called to
                            discuss integration. When the Secretary asked what would be Romania's
                            position, President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said
                            it was clear - they were against it. What about the other countries in
                                <gloss target="#t_COMECON1">COMECON</gloss>, asked the Secretary.
                            Some of them have reservations but they'll go along, said President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>. In fact the Poles
                            are one of the strong supporters of the plan, as are the Bulgarians. The
                            Secretary interposed “Then you'll be isolated.” “It won't be for the
                            first time,” said President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then remarked how several of the Eastern European countries
                            had talked to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> representatives at the
                            Helsinki conference about improving their relations with the United
                            States, and asked what would be President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName>'s advice as to how the United States should
                            treat them - in what order for example after Romania of course.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> reflected for
                            a while and then said he thought it was worthwhile trying to improve
                            relations with them all. The President recalled that the Bulgarian
                            representative at Helsinki had made a particular effort to be friendly,
                            and President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> noted the
                            existence of good Romanian-Bulgarian relations. After he mentioned that
                            the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had already made a good start with
                            Poland, the Secretary asked about East Germany in view of the fact that
                            we had maintained a certain reserve with them. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said that in the recent past
                            Romanian relations with East Germany had improved considerably. At the
                            same time what the East Germans could do was obviously limited by the
                            Potsdam treaty and they too would always go along with the Soviets.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_BHGJ1">Barnes</persName> mentioned that
                            for that matter all the other European countries in <gloss
                                target="#t_COMECON1">COMECON</gloss> had Soviet troops on their
                            territory save Bulgaria and this could not help but limit their options.
                            The Secretary said that knowing the Germans he could believe they might
                            succeed in uniting in 15 years. They're romantics. They'll probably set
                            themselves up as teachers of communism to the whole world. President
                            Ceausescu responded that he agreed they would reunite though he wasn't
                            so sure it would happen within 15 years. (At about this point the
                            Secretary picked up the map of Romania which had been brought in at the
                            President's request and a geography lesson ensued which concentrated on
                            territories lost by Romania to the Soviets - President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> talking about the
                            “restitution” to the Soviet Union of Bessarabia <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="d37-04" facs="d37-04"/>after World War II and the ceding of
                            Northern Bukovina as “damages” for Romania's having held Bessarabia for
                            20 years. In fact, he noted, Romania in some ways fared better at
                            Hitler's hands because Hitler turned down Molotov's November 1940
                            ultimatum to give the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a free hand
                            in Romania and Bulgaria which would have meant the Soviets taking a
                            still larger slice of northern Romania. In the context of talking about
                            the differences of railway gauge between the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and other countries, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> noted that the Bulgarians were
                            urging Romania to build a wide gauge (Soviet type) line across Romania,
                            but the Romanians were not interested.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked who President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> thought would succeed <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> said it was just hard to say
                            and the Secretary then asked what he thought about post Brezhnev Soviet
                            policies, would they be tougher or more flexible. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName> replied “They could hardly be
                            tougher than they are now.” “What about Shelepin?” asked President
                                <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>. Saying “We've had
                            fairly good experience with him,” President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> proceeded to recount the story of the Romanian
                            gold bullion and royal treasure sent to Moscow In 1916 for safekeeping
                            but which has never been returned. Lenin apparently signed a decree in
                            1918 stating that all would be restored after the establishment of a
                            workers' and peasants' government in Romania. In 1960 the Romanians
                            inquired of the Soviets whether they were yet prepared to believe that
                            such a government had been installed in Romania. The initial Soviet
                            reaction was to deny any knowledge of the gold, but Shelepin
                            subsequently was one of those who was in favor of at a least taking a
                            serious look at the Romanian request. The Secretary noted that for
                            someone like Shelepin it's hard to make a comeback once you've lost your
                            power base, and that the ranks of the Soviet leadership is no place for
                            choir boys. President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>
                            said the truth of the matter is that the whole present Soviet leadership
                            is made up of people who got where they are thanks to Stalin, and only
                            with a change to younger people will there be some real changes in
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked whether <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> had firm enough control to be able to make
                            decisions stick. “On little, unimportant things” responded President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>, “like - <gloss
                                target="#t_MBFR1">MBFR</gloss>.” What did he think of <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s health? He said he was of
                            course no doctor, but his own personal view was that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> would finish the same way
                            Pompidou had. When the President wondered whether <persName

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: I know you wanted
                            to talk about world economic conditions. How would you like to
                            proceed?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I know that
                            the United States is very much concerned with these problems as is
                            Romania - the problems of economic crisis, the oil problem and raw
                            materials. Solutions need to be sought together in our opinion with all
                            countries involved and not only by just a few operating in restricted
                            groups as has been tried. Solutions involving just certain countries of
                            course can be found but they don't get to the root of the problem. In
                            the first place, almost all the socialist countries remain outside these
                            groups which diminishes very greatly the results of any negotiations. In
                            the second place, there remain outside also a number of developing
                            countries which are producers of raw materials and in general there's
                            been a tendency to discuss only the oil problem most of the time. Oil is
                            of course important but it's only one side of the problem of the
                            economic situation. In addition, there will be the special session on
                            these problems. Practically nobody knows what's going to be discussed
                            there.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d38-02" facs="d38-02"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: You mean the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: There were
                            some attempts at discussions in Paris which didn't produce any results;
                            now there's talk about their being renewed but on the same basis.
                            Therefore it's clear from the very start that the possibility of their
                            obtaining any results is limited.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: You mean the
                            producer-consumer discussions?</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: Yes. Our
                            concern - we think it is important to work from the basis of tying
                            together energy, raw materials and industrial products. There needs also
                            to be found some price stability for raw materials and energy and
                            industrial products and at the same time in this framework a certain
                            amount of support needs to be given to the less developed countries;
                            because if the gap between the developed and the underdeveloped
                            countries is maintained, it'll be difficult to provide for any real
                            development. The very basis for selling industrial products for that
                            matter is limited in this sort of situation and of course all that flows
                            from this so far as general international relations are concerned. In
                            any case, if these problems remain where they are now, they will lead to
                            many complications and confrontations. In our opinion it would be
                            necessary to create some sort of organ, probably best of all within the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> framework, in which all countries
                            would participate, to work out solutions for all these problems. Of
                            course in the meanwhile there are some partial solutions which can be
                            found but for basic solutions and for even something in the way of
                            economic stability and for some sort of progress, some principles, some
                            norms have to be worked out which would form the basis for all
                            states.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: Mr. President, I
                            fully recognize that economic problems are equally serious whether they
                            in a capitalist state or socialist state <pb n="3" xml:id="d38-03"
                                facs="d38-03"/>because they lead to human suffering and deter or
                            stop progress. I know of course more about the problems of a capitalist
                            country such as the United States than about the problems of this kind
                            in a socialist state. But I can't help but believe that many problems
                            are somewhat similar and therefore I can see why there should be a
                            higher degree of cooperation between capitalist and socialist societies.
                            The United States in the last year has gone through a very serious
                            economic recession. Unemployment has been too high, preceded by
                            inflation that was too high. We've taken strong measures In the United
                            States and, I think, made substantial progress against inflation. We are
                            now convinced our unemployment will get less and less and the economy as
                            a whole in the next twelve months will show signs of improvement. But
                            other capitalist states - France, West Germany, Great Britain - have had
                            the same kind of economic problems as we and they have not yet been as
                            successful as we in meeting these problems.</p>
                        <p>We do intend to work together because there is an inter-dependence
                            between Europe and North America. I think that, if we can have a <gloss
                                target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss> in areas where we have agreed, we
                            should explore the possibilities for broader economic cooperation. Of
                            course you will continue to have bilateral cooperation in the economic
                            field by such actions as those we have taken today. It would be our
                            judgment that oil has been a significant contributing factor to the
                            excessive rise in the cost of living and the very precipitous rise in
                            the cost of living has had serious impact on economic problems in the
                            United States, the recession. But oil is not the only villain. Higher
                            food prices created by adverse weather conditions and other reasons have
                            played a role. Now we do feel OPEC, for example, went too far in
                            increasing oil prices. It makes it very difficult for me, for our
                            country which has substantial amounts of grain to be generous and to
                            sell to them when we are <pb n="4" xml:id="d38-04" facs="d38-04"
                            />charged far too high prices, many think, by OPEC. With OPEC using oil
                            for its purposes, it's very difficult for me, for the United States, not
                            to use our surplus food in a very direct way in our national
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>Now we are working as you know with oil-consuming nations to work out
                            with a number of oil producers meetings where these critical problems
                            can be resolved. These talks have now been broadened to include other
                            raw materials and now another group has been set up involving less
                            developed nations.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of the less developed countries, since my coming to Congress in
                            1949, the United States has sought to help them with grants of money,
                            technical assistance and credits. We believe that a healthy world
                            depends on the less developed countries having a better line and on
                            narrowing the gap between them and the developed countries and we're
                            working in this group with the less developed countries along these
                            lines. To sum it up, I would repeat one very important word -
                            interdependence. Whether it's a matter of less developed countries,
                            socialist countries or capitalist countries, we live on one globe and
                            our economic welfare and progress are tied in with the underdeveloped
                            countries. Whether we do it by groups, by bilateral approaches or
                            globally, if we're going to achieve human progress and end human tragedy
                            we have to do better than we have done and we are glad to work in all
                            three areas.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: To be sure,
                            all that you have said is completely justified. There exists an
                            interdependence which is becoming stronger and stronger but bilateral
                            solutions by themselves are not going to solve anything. What the
                            situation calls for is to reach some general understanding on the
                            relationships between raw materials, oil, agricultural products and
                            industrial products. What we're thinking about is to find some sort of
                            an approach preferably within the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            context <pb n="5" xml:id="d38-05" facs="d38-05"/>and then go on to the
                            working out of some equitable principles and norms to assure a certain
                            stability in the realm of prices and thereby to prevent happening what
                            happened with oil.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: In 1973.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: In the second
                            place a program, a more general one, which would take into account the
                            need to solve the problems of the developing countries, some more
                            general form. It is a problem …</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: This through the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: I think the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is the most appropriate. Of course
                            there will continue to be bilateral agreements but they're not by their
                            nature of the sort to solve the underlying problem of
                            underdevelopment.</p>
                        <p>What I would like in connection with these problems and taking into
                            account that they will be raised in a month or so, would be that there
                            be if possible some cooperation in this spirit between our
                            representatives and those of other countries including the a United
                            States. I must tell you that not even the socialist countries know what
                            sort of position they should take. They're not even really all that
                            ready to act in this direction. I'm thinking of <gloss target="#t_CEMA1"

                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: It might be
                            interesting for Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> to make some observations since he has worked
                            closely with this problem.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Firstly, we
                            don't believe the problem of development can be solved by confrontation
                            because this creates the illusion that the redistribution of wealth can
                            solve the problem. What we need is a process of growth whereby the
                            fruits of growth can be distributed. So it is very important that
                            developing countries come to the conference in a constructive frame of
                            mind. We are <pb n="6" xml:id="d38-06" facs="d38-06"/>also going in that
                            frame of mind. You know in our country many feel we should ignore this
                            problem and rely on our economic strength to protect our interests. But
                            the President is not pursuing this course. We are going to make a number
                            of concrete proposals on energy, raw materials and development. We are
                            prepared to join in groups and study each of these problems.</p>
                        <p>In the field of raw materials, we don't think price stability is the
                            answer, it's not enforceable and besides would lead to limitations on
                            production. Incidentally, the two countries which would benefit the most
                            would be the United States and the Soviet Union. But we are prepared to
                            have income stabilization in which prices can fluctuate but for the
                            developing countries one works out stability of income. This has no
                            benefit for us but stabilization would substitute for economic aid. But
                            we are prepared and will make specific proposals at the special
                            session.</p>
                        <p>It might be good if we had some of your ideas because Romania could play
                            a constructive role with the less developed countries and a keep the
                            debate on a positive level.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>: In this sense
                            it would be good if at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> there could
                            exist a certain coordination to the extent it was possible.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree. When
                            I'm in New York I'll talk with Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MG4">Macovescu</persName> and I'll have Moynihan get in
                            touch with your people.</p>

                            (FROM WHATEVER SOURCE) IT THEREBY ENHANCES THE CAPABILITY OF THE WARSAW
                            PACT IS A TOUGH ARGUMENT TO PARRY - AT LEAST BY ITS PACT PARTNERS. I
                            CONCLUDE THAT THE ROMANIANS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE SCALE OF THE SUPPLY
                            RELATIONSHIP THEY SEEK WITH THE U.S. (WHICH THEY PROBABLY DEFINE AS

                            COMMENT AT ANY LENGTH BUT WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY RELEVANT ARE OUR OVERALL

                        </p>
                        <p>Secretary's Office</p>
                        <p>DISTRIBUTION: S (Adams, Bremer), <gloss target="#t_SS1"
                                >S/S</gloss>,<gloss target="#t_WH1">WH</gloss> (Rodman)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Sorry to have kept you waiting. I didn't know we were
                            going to have such a big meeting. What are the Romanians asking for?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: They have given us a
                            shopping list which contains twelve types of equipment.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Why do you think they want it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: Presumably they feel
                            they need it; they feel they are not getting what they want from the
                            Soviets. They presumably want to diversify their sources of supply. It
                            probably has a symbolic significance for them.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Do they want this on cash or credit?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ANG1">Andrews</persName>: They have given no
                            indication.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d40-02" facs="d40-02"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: They have not
                            said.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Can we do this legally?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AGHL1">Aldrich</persName>: It is not flatly
                            illegal. There is no specific prohibition in the Battle Act because it
                            was assumed that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> wouldn't want to
                            do this, and the Act was aimed at preventing our allies from doing this.
                            It doesn't say explicitly that we can't do this. If we do it, it would
                            create political problems but not legal ones. The reasons are:</p>
                        <p>First, we would have difficulty in <gloss target="#t_COCOM1"
                                >COCOM</gloss> with our allies.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the President would have to determine that providing this
                            equipment under Foreign Military Sales would strengthen the security of
                            the United States and promote world peace.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the question would be how quickly Congress would come back and
                            stop it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I think the <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                            problem would have to be weighed. Would all the equipment be subject to
                                <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: They are all highly
                            technology items.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: How would the Russians react?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: They wouldn't like
                            it, but they probably wouldn't do anything.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: There's one option of giving them this equipment if the
                            Russians are involved with one of our allies. What do you have in
                            mind?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: If the Russians, for
                            example, provided military equipment to Portugal, which doesn't seem
                            very likely at the moment.</p>
                        <p>Stern: There have been reports that the Turks might be dealing with the
                            Russians.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Do we owe them an answer?</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d40-03" facs="d40-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: Yes. This came up
                            when their Chief of Staff was here several months ago.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Is there anything attractive about putting it off?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_AGHL1">Aldrich</persName>: This would be useful in
                            Congressional terms because the Foreign Assistance package has just gone
                            up. Putting it off would be helpful.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: The choice then is between temporizing and turning it
                            down. They are in the same situation as the Egyptians and their arms
                            package.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: We can do the
                            communications equipment for Ceausescu's aircraft.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I already approved it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: This would show our
                            good faith. We can look into what can be done commercially.</p>
                        <p>Michel: The advantage of commercial sales is that they don't require a
                            Presidential determination.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ANG1">Andrews</persName>: Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BHGJ1">Barnes</persName> favors the temporizing option
                            because he would like to explore the Romanian rationale for coming to
                            us.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Is someone from <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            here?</p>
                        <p>Jefferson: Yes.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: What does <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> think?</p>
                        <p>Jefferson: <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> has no particular
                            preference as between temporizing and turning it down.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Why doesn't <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> want to do
                            it?</p>
                        <p>Jefferson: Largely because of <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss>
                            where we have interests which are much more important than this
                            case.</p>
                        <p>Stern: <gloss target="#t_COCOM1">COCOM</gloss> is a very indiscriminating
                            weapon. This list of materiel impacts on <gloss target="#t_DOD1"

                        <p>The Secretary: Obviously we wouldn't strip the military readiness
                            posture. Which items would impact?</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: My inclination is to temporize.</p>
                        <p>Michel: We shouldn't temporize in a way which would arouse expectations
                            which we could not fulfill.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: What price do we pay if we do-not fulfill them?</p>

                        <p>The Secretary: I would give them that if we can do it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: We tell them that we
                            can do the communications equipment and we are looking into the space
                            research things.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: And the military items presents us with very grave
                            problems. All right. Sorry to have kept you waiting.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName>Andrei</persName>: First of all, I have a message of
                            friendship for you from President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Thank you.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Andrei</persName>: He speaks of you often, recalling the
                            meetings you have had.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: You know, I am a great admirer of your President. I think that
                            the relations between the United States and Romania are among the more
                            important things I have done since I have been in Washington.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d41-02" facs="d41-02"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Andrei</persName>: I want to express my own personal
                            appreciation because my visit here is linked, indirectly at least, with
                            the invitation you extended at the dinner my President gave for you and
                            with the discussion I had had earlier with Messrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>. The main idea of my visit is
                            to discuss how we can develop these relations still further.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I didn't know
                                <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName> had any friends
                            left in Romania.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Andrei</persName>: I am surprised that, knowing what you know,
                            you could have reached that conclusion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You used <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName> as an opportunity to say
                            things you wanted to say. We understand.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Andrei</persName>: This is a question we consider to have been
                            closed for some time already. It's a matter which was connected with the
                            idea of spheres of influence and all the consequences thereof.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: But all our policies
                            toward Romania prove that we don't accept this idea.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d41-03" facs="d41-03"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Andrei</persName>: That's correct. The President asked me to
                            remind you of the discussions at Sinaia and Bucharest on this issue,
                            especially with regard to his saying that we welcome the development of
                            relations between the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, with the condition that nothing
                            affecting our interests be done behind our back. He said you'd remember
                            this.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I remember very well. But we told him he had no reason to be
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Andrei</persName>: He didn't mention that.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Excessive trust in what people tell him is not characteristic
                            of your President.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Andrei</persName>: He just gave me the message of what I was
                            to say and not to tell to you what to say. We consider our relations to
                            be good. The President asked me to mention three questions. First of all
                            is that dealing with our economic relations. He specifically asked me to
                            tell you that although there now exists a situation where Romanian
                            exports exceed the value of imports from the United States, there are
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d41-04" facs="d41-04"/>contracts being negotiated
                            which will equalize things. And we are extremely interested in importing
                            goods and equipment from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            especially in the industrial field. It is true that this year in any
                            case imports of grains will be down somewhat. The President hopes that
                            we can reach our target of $1 billion in two-way trade before 1980.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he asked me to say, and this is something he would like you to
                            keep on the agenda for after the Presidential elections, namely the
                            reexamination of our requests for credits, on concessional terms, for
                            the importation of equipment from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.
                            I repeat this is something for after the elections. We proceed from the
                            fact that the consolidation of Romania's situation has been helped very
                            much by Presidents <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and that for the
                            further consolidation of Romania's independence, as the President asked
                            me to tell you, the most effective sort of help will be strengthening
                            our <pb n="5" xml:id="d41-05" facs="d41-05"/>bilateral relations,
                            working together on international problems, intensifying our trade and
                            in other ways with the result that Romania develops more both materially
                            and spiritually.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Spiritually?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Andrei</persName>: You know well of course what is required
                            when it is a question of industrialization, of providing services for
                            the population, developing agriculture in order to raise the material
                            level. You know these efforts we have been making and we see them also
                            as a political “conduit” as it were (to raise the spiritual level). In
                            fact, we tell other developing countries that the most important factor
                            for making progress is their own efforts toward development. Thirdly,
                            our President was somewhat unhappy (“amarit”) over the demonstrations on
                            Transylvania that have taken place in the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and he has asked me to express the hope to you and to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> that, within the
                            framework of the laws in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, this
                            sort of attitude could be discouraged by the administration, especially
                            since it raises territorial <pb n="6" xml:id="d41-06" facs="d41-06"
                            />questions. It's a delicate problem and I really don't want to go into
                            much detail.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, actually this is my third point, With regard to <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>, so far as emigration to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> is concerned, we have resolved the major
                            part of the problems and will settle those remaining. We don't have any
                            important problems with regard to emigration to Israel, and we will
                            solve those that remain. We don't want to create conditions that make it
                            difficult for the administration. With the help of the State Department
                            I have had some meetings already with members of Congress and will have
                            some more. We will take action at home along the lines I have told
                            you.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: How long will you stay?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Andrei</persName>: That depends on the President.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Your meeting will definitely take place.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_SHH1">Sonnenfeldt</persName>: We're still waiting

                            <persName>Andrei</persName>: I have to be in Berlin Thursday in
                            connection with preparations for the European Communist Party
                            Conference.</p>

                        <p>Secretary: You won't delay your departure for a meeting with the
                            President?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Andrei</persName>: If I did, I wouldn't be able to say that I
                            had succeeded in avoiding being subject to too much <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> influence.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: I'm positive the President will see you. I think it's
                            Monday.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: Probably Tuesday.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: You see. I run a bunch of African tribes here. They keep going
                            around trading information with each other.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName>Andrei</persName>: And you're the last to hear it. Finally, I
                            can affirm that for a variety of reasons we are interested in seeing our
                            relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> develop and I hope
                            that we will continue to find from the American side the same
                            receptivity toward their expansion both bilaterally and with regard to
                            international problems that concern us both.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: With respect to the issues you raise, we have attached
                            considerable importance to the development of relations between our
                            countries and it would be totally inconsistent with the strategy which
                            we are pursuing <pb n="8" xml:id="d41-08" facs="d41-08"/>to establish
                            spheres of influence. The whole purpose of the visits to Romania has
                            been to demonstrate that we don't accept the establishment of spheres of
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>On economic issues, we would welcome the goal you have set for overall
                            trade. On matters that require legislation, I agree it is better to wait
                            until after the elections.</p>
                        <p>On <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss>, you know the position the
                            Administration has taken on this issue. We have to meet certain tests
                            which the Congress has imposed. We also recognize you can't throw people
                            out of your country on account of the prescriptions others set for you.
                            Still, some progress, particularly with respect to emigration to Israel,
                            would help. What particular steps are up to you to decide.</p>
                        <p>On the demonstrations, I frankly didn't know about those at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> until several weeks ago. I'm always so
                            relieved <pb n="9" xml:id="d41-09" facs="d41-09"/>when they're not
                            directed against me which is usually my fate and it's usually a Greek
                            group. In fact, I thought they were demonstrating against me and was
                            amazed to find it was one of the few not aimed against me. I asked our
                            Ambassador there to see what they can do. The fact is, as you know, that
                            the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government has no sympathy with
                            the object of these demonstrations. Sometimes we could understand the
                            objectives of some protests but the methods would not be acceptable. But
                            we consider that the territory of Romania is not a proper objective. We
                            support the territorial integrity of Romania. There are other
                            difficulties on account of the Federal-State relationships. It is very
                            difficult to impose restraints on the states. I've told our Mission to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to do whatever they can do. Have
                            the demonstrations been peaceful?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: So far. Some of the
                            signs are awful.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: Is there anything we can do?</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d41-10" facs="d41-10"/>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HAA4">Hartman</persName>: Unless they incite
                            violence, no. The police do keep them away from the buildings.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: How long has this been going on?</p>
                        <p>

                            Congressman Helstoski asked me about the Hungarian minority last year.
                            He's under indictment now. He's of Polish origin, from Newark.</p>
                        <p>Mitran: He has some Hungarian constituents, too.</p>
                        <p>Secretary: We'll do what we can through our Mission in New York.</p>

                        <p>The White House</p>
                        <p>The President: It is a great pleasure to have you here. I have just read
                            the letter from President <persName corresp="#p_CN4"
                                >Ceausescu</persName> and it reaffirms, as I do to you, the good
                            relations we have between our countries and the desire on our part and
                            yours to continue and to expand them. Please extend my best wishes to
                            your President. I enjoyed my visit to Romania and we were delighted to
                            have him visit here.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AS5">Andrei</persName>: I would like to give
                            you the original of the President's letter and on this occasion extend
                            on behalf of my President and his wife to you and Mrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> their greetings and very best
                            wishes for happiness and success. My President recalls with pleasure
                            your visit to Bucharest and he hopes to meet you again so as to continue
                            the dialogue with you. Right now it's the time of the presidential
                            election campaign and the President told me he doesn't want to interfere
                            in the internal affairs of the United States but he would like to wish
                            you much success so he would be able to carry on this dialogue with you,
                            to exchange views on questions concerning the relations between our two
                            countries and on international matters.</p>
                        <p>The President: Will you express to the President my appreciation for his
                            kind words and tell him I look forward to continuing this dialogue for
                            the next four years.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AS5">Andrei</persName>: Speaking of the
                            relations between our two countries, our President considers them as
                            good. He appreciates the special role you personally have had. It is our
                            desire to develop these relations, including economic relations, and in
                            view of, or anticipating the results of the elections, we ask you to
                            retain on your agenda the question of supporting Romania through a
                            credit on advantageous terms which would enable us to purchase equipment
                            and technology from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The President: I consider the economic relations we have a very important
                            element in our overall relations. We strongly believe we should continue
                            the <gloss target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> relations we have. I submitted
                            to the Congress the necessary recommendations on June 2 so Congress
                            would have the opportunity to act affirmatively. The best information I
                            have indicates that Congress may temporarily delay this affirmative act
                            on the recommendations I made for extending <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss>. You know, as I do, the problem we have with the
                            Congress. When President <persName corresp="#p_CN4">Ceausescu</persName>
                            was here he met with several committees to explain the policy of your
                            country to them. He heard directly from Members of Congress the feelings
                            they had. I just hope we will have some evidence that will respond to
                            the views Congress has and if these responses are encouraging there will
                            be no problem whatever with extending <gloss target="#t_MFN1"
                                >MFN</gloss>.</p>

                        <p>CONTINGENCY STUDY FOR ROMANIA</p>
                        <p>Summary</p>
                        <p>There are broadly speaking two sets of contingencies which can arise with
                            respect to Romania. Typically they will be interrelated. Both would
                            result from the state of Romanian-Soviet relations. One is military,
                            ranging from threats of military action to outright invasion. The other
                            is political, where tensions in the Warsaw Pact and a change - possibly
                            violent - of the Romanian leadership would result in enhanced Soviet
                            influence in Romania.</p>
                        <p>None of these contingencies is likely to affect U.S. and <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> security interests directly. They
                            would, however, importantly affect U.S. and <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> political interests, since they would point - and in
                            some cases amount - to a resurgence of the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> Doctrine. Increased Soviet dominance in Romania
                            would also tend to affect Yugoslavia adversely. Any invasion of Romania
                            by the Soviet Union would upset current efforts to improve East-West
                            relations, foreclose increased bilateral relations and pose the problem
                            of protecting U.S. interests in Romania.</p>
                        <p>The objective of all action options during phases of strong Soviet/Warsaw
                            Pact pressures or threatened invasion would be to bring home to the
                            Soviets, through preventive diplomacy, the risks of such policies. At
                            the same time any contingency limited to Romania is not likely to lead
                            to a Western decision to intervene militarily.</p>
                        <p>The range of likely options extends from diplomatic warnings to the
                            interruption of on-going efforts to improve the East-West climate, as
                            well as possible economic measures. It would be important to coordinate
                            these steps in <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and take any action
                            only in a <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> context.</p>

                                    POLAND'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE FRG HAS UNDERGONE A FUNDAMENTAL AND

                                    WARINESS: AND POLISH-US RELATIONS HAVE UNDERGONE A DRAMATIC
                                    IMPROVEMENT. IN THE MULTILATERAL SPHERE, POLAND HAS SHOWN
                                    INCREASED ACTIVITY WHICH FITS IN WITH ITS OWN PREDILECTIONS.
                                    POLISH TRADE WITH THE WEST HAS INCREASED BOTH IN ABSOLUTE AND
                                    QUALITATIVE TERMS AND AS A SHARE OF TOTAL TRADE. AT HOME, THE
                                    REGIME IS PURSUING THE DUAL AIM OF ENDEAVORING TO SATISFY

                                    ECONOMY. IN THE FORMER, IT CONTINUES TO MAKE SATISFACTORY
                                    PROGRESS IN IMPROVING THE SUPPLY OF CONSUMER GOODS. IN ORDER TO
                                    ACHIEVE ITS MODERNIZATION GOALS, IT IS COUNTING HEAVILY, AND
                                    PERHAPS TOO MUCH SO, ON AN INFLUX OF ADVANCED WESTERN

                                COUNTING ON EXPLOITING UNTAPPED “RESERVES”, PROMOTING ABOVE-PLAN
                                PRODUCTION (30 BILLION ZLOTIES WORTH IS SOUGHT THIS YEAR), CURBING
                                ABSENTEEISM (WHICH ROSE SHARPLY LAST YEAR), AND MAKING AT LEAST SOME

                                DECEMBER: THAT THE GAINS WERE ACHIEVED IN LARGE MEASURE, NOT THROUGH
                                INCREASE IN PRODUCTIVITY, BUT AT A CONSIDERABLE COST IN EXTRA LABOR
                                AND SOME DEFICITS IN THE FOREIGN TRADE ACCOUNTS.</item>

                        <p>1. IN ABSENCE OF FOREIGN MINISTER ( WHO IS EN ROUTE</p>
                        <p>HOME TODAY FROM BELGRADE), I SAW ACTING FOREIGN MINISTER<lb/>TREPCZYNSKI
                            AT 11:30 A. M. LOCAL AND MADE REPRESENTATION<lb/>TO HIM AS INSTRUCTED,
                            CLOSELY FOLLOWING LANGUAGE OF<lb/>REF B. TREPCZYNSKI TOOK CAREFUL
                            NOTES.</p>
                        <p>2. RESPONDING, TREPCZYNSKI SAID THAT POLISH GOVERNMENT<lb/>WAS INTERESTED
                            IN FULL RESPECT FOR THE PARIS AGREEMENT.<lb/>THEY HAD ENTERED INTO ICCS
                            ROLE AT THE INVITATION OF THE<lb/>INTERESTED PARTIES BECAUSE THEY WISHED
                            TO SERVE THE CAUSE<lb/>OF PEACE, OF GOOD RELATIONS BETWEEN THEMSELVES
                            AND ALL THE<lb/>PARTIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, AND THE
                            DETENTE<lb/>IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. THEY WERE AWARE THEY WERE<lb/>ENTERING
                            INTO A COMPLICATED SITUATION. IT HAD<lb/>PROVEN TO BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR
                            THE ICCS TO ACCOMPLISH<lb/>ITS MISSION. THERE WERE ONLY 1200 PEOPLE
                            INVOLVED,<lb/>A SMALL NUMBER IN VIEW OF THE OBJECTIVE OF ASSURING
                            PEACE</p>

                        <p>IN SOUTH VIETNAM. MOREOVER, CONDITIONS IN SOUTH VIETNAM<lb/>WERE VERY
                            DIFFICULT. THERE HAD BEEN MANY VIOLATIONS BY THE<lb/>SOUTH VIETNAMESE
                            FORCES. SECURITY CONDITIONS FOR THE<lb/>POLISH DELEGATION WERE VERY
                            DIFFICULT. BUT THE POLISH<lb/>GOVERNMENT WAS INTERESTED IN CLEARING THIS
                            SITUATION UP<lb/>AND OF FULFILLING ITS INTENTION OF MAKING A
                            CONTRIBUTION<lb/>TO PEACE. AMBASSADOR WASILEWSKI HAD ARRIVED IN WARSAW
                            AND<lb/>IN CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM, THE POLISH GOVERNMENT<lb/>WANTS TO
                            SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE TO CLEAR THE SITUATION UP.<lb/>TREPCZYNSKI EXPECTED
                            TO SEE HIS HUNGARIAN COUNTERPART, VICE<lb/>MINISTER JARJAI, IN THE NEXT
                            FEW DAYS FOR CONSULTATIONS.<lb/>THE POLES WANT TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION,
                            BUT THE<lb/>COMMISSION HAS VERY LIMITED POSSIBILITIES. THAT IS WHY
                            THEY<lb/>WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE A LINK MADE BETWEEN THE WORK OF
                            THE<lb/>ICCS AND US- POLISH BILATERAL RELATIONS. TREPCZYNSKI
                            ADDED<lb/>THAT HE HAD BEEN INFORMED ONLY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE MY
                            CALL<lb/>THAT A HELICOPTER HAD BEEN SHOT DOWN “ SOMEWHERE IN
                            SOUTH<lb/>VIETNAM” WITH THREE POLISH OFFICERS IN IT; DETAILS
                            WERE<lb/>LACKING SO FAR. THIS ILLUSTRATED THE DIFFICULTIES
                            UNDER<lb/>WHICH THE ICCS WORKED. MOREOVER, THE SAIGON GOVERNMENT
                            DOES<lb/>NOT SEEM TO BE MOVING TO FULFILL THE POLITICAL<lb/>PROVISIONS
                            OF THE PEACE AGREEMENTS. WE WOULD NOTE<lb/>THAT THE POLISH PRESS HAD
                            STOPPED PUBLISHING THE KIND<lb/>OF REPORTS ON THE SITUATION IN VIETNAM
                            WHICH WE HAD<lb/>CHARACTERIZED AS TENDENTIOUS. THERE HAD BEEN
                            SOME<lb/>INACCURACIES IN THESEREPORTS AND THAT KIND OF
                            PRESS<lb/>COVERAGE HAD BEEN STOPPED. IN CONCLUSION, TREPCZYNSKI<lb/>HAD
                            SAID, THE DIFFICULTIES WERE GREAT, BUT THE POLISH<lb/>GOVERNMENT WAS NOW
                            MOVING TO SEE WHAT COULD BE DONE TO<lb/>CLEAR THEM UP.</p>
                        <p>3. I SAID THAT WE HAD BEEN OVER THIS GROUND BEFORE, BUT<lb/>I WISHED TO
                            POINT OUT: ( A) WE HAD NEVER CONTENDED THERE<lb/>WERE VIOLATIONS ON ONE
                            SIDE ONLY. THE POINT WAS THAT<lb/>THERE APPEARED TO BE NO GREAT
                            DIFFICULTY IN THE ICCS IN<lb/>AGREEING TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS
                            ON THE SAIGON<lb/>SIDE. THE DIFFICULTY AROSE WHEN THE CHARGES DEALT
                            WITH<lb/>DRV/PRG VIOLATIONS. THEN THE POLES AND HUNGARIANS
                            FOUND<lb/>WAYS TO DELAY, OBSTRUCT, AND FRUSTRATE THE HOLDING
                            OF<lb/>INVESTIGATIONS AND THE SUBMISSION OF REPORTS. WITH
                            THE<lb/>EXPERIENCE THE POLES HAD HAD IN THE OLD ICC, WE HAD<lb/>EXPECTED
                            THEM NOT TO FALL INTO THE OLD TRAP WHICH HAD FRUSTRATED</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>THE EFFORTS OF THAT BODY. IT WAS NECESSARY THAT JUSTICE SHOULD<lb/>BE
                            DONE IMPARTIALLY AND OBJECTIVELY TO CHARGES REGARDING
                            ALL<lb/>VIOLATIONS. ( B) TALKS HERE, AND IN SAIGON, ABOUT
                            ADMINISTRATIVE<lb/>AND SECURITY DIFFICULTIES LOOKED TO US LIKE YET
                            ANOTHER MEANS<lb/>OF AVOIDING THE ISSUE. THE CANDADIANS
                            AND<lb/>INDONESIANS WORKED UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AS THE<lb/>POLES
                            AND HUNGARIANS. SO THE MINISTER COULD UNDERSTAND<lb/>OUR CONVICTION THAT
                            INVESTIGATIONS COULD BE UNDERTAKEN<lb/>AND IMPARTIAL REPORTS PRODUCED,
                            IF THE WILL EXISTED TO<lb/>DO SO. ( C) NO ONE HAD EXPECTED THAT THE ICCS
                            WOULD<lb/>FIND ITS TASK AN EASY ONE. BUT THE POLES HAD<lb/>UNDERTAKEN
                            THIS OBLIGATION, A CONCRETE SITUATION NOW<lb/>EXISTED IN VIETNAM, WHICH
                            MUST BE DEALT WITH, AND WE<lb/>EXPECTED THE REVIEW THE POLISH GOVERNMENT
                            WAS NOW UNDER-<lb/>TAKING TO RESULT IN IMPROVEMENTS. I COULD ADD ON
                            A<lb/>PERSONAL BASIS THAT I HAD HEARD IN WARSAW SOME
                            CYNICAL<lb/>COMMENTS TO THE EFFECT THAT THE PEACE AGREEMENTS
                            WERE<lb/>SIMPLY DESIGNED TO COVER RELEASE OF US PRISONERS AND
                            WITH-<lb/>DRAWAL OF US FORCES FROM VIETNAM, FOLLOWING WHICH WE
                            WOULD<lb/>WASH OUR HANDS OF THE WHOLE SITUATION. NOTHING COULD
                            BE<lb/>FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH. INDEED, THE RETURN OF OUR<lb/>PRISONERS
                            AND TROOPS HAD ONLY INCREASED THE FEELING<lb/>OF OUR PEOPLE THAT THOSE
                            WHO WERE NOT SO FORTUNATE AND HAD<lb/>DIED IN VIETNAM MUST NOT HAVE DONE
                            SO IN VAIN. ( D) WITH<lb/>REGARD TO THE CONNECTION BETWEEN POLISH
                            PARTICIPATION IN<lb/>THE ICCS AND US- POLISH BILATERAL RELATIONS, I
                            REGARDED THIS<lb/>AS A POLITICAL FACT OF NATURE, AS I HAD EXPLAINED TO
                            SPASOWSKI<lb/>EARLIER. THE MINISTER COULD NOT EXPECT THAT SUCH A
                            CONNECTION<lb/>WOULD NOT BE MADE. WHEN I THOUGHT OF ALL THE ACTIVITIES
                            NOW<lb/>GOING ON, E. G., THE VISIT OF EX- IM BANK PRESIDENT<lb/>KEARNS,
                            AND THE PROMISE THEY HAVE FOR THE FUTURE, IT<lb/>SEEMED TO ME ALL

                        <p>ACTION</p>
                        <p>June 18, 1973</p>
                        <p>First Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> of the
                            Polish Communist Party has sent you the letter at Tab C reflecting on
                            the progress in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Polish relations since
                            your visit to Warsaw a year ago. He notes his satisfaction with this
                            progress, and he thanks you in particular for your official proclamation
                            recognizing the 500th Anniversary of Copernicus.</p>
                        <p>In forwarding First Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName>'s letter, Poland's Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TW2">Trampczynski</persName> has also written (Tab D) to
                            express his appreciation for your contribution to the Copernicus
                            celebrations, and he presents you with a facsimile commemorative edition
                            of Copernicus work “De Revolutionibus.”</p>
                        <p>While not stated in this correspondence, the Poles are hopeful that you
                            will extend an invitation to First Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> to visit the United States later this year.</p>
                        <p>At present, while there has been the progress in our bilateral relations
                            cited by First Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName>,<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Polish
                            relations have been complicated by Poland's partial and inadequate
                            performance in the <gloss target="#t_ICCS1">ICCS</gloss>. Over the past
                            several months we have been urging the Poles to improve their conduct in
                            Vietnam and to show impartiality in their <gloss target="#t_ICCS1"
                                >ICCS</gloss> supervisory role; this has met with little success. In
                            our approaches to the Poles we have specifically linked their
                            performance in Vietnam to further improvements in <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>-Polish bilateral relations. Thus, at this point it would
                            not be desirable to communicate with <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> on the possibility of his visiting the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>In my opinion, First Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName>'s letter does afford you an excellent opportunity
                            to address the question of Poland's performance in the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICCS1">ICCS</gloss>. If you agree, and if as a result of
                            the exchange of correspondence Polish <gloss target="#t_ICCS1"
                                >ICCS</gloss> performance improves, you may then wish to consider
                            whether an invitation should be extended to the Polish First
                            Secretary.</p>

                        <p>Dear Mr. Secretary:</p>
                        <p>Your letter of May 31 is greatly appreciated. I agree that the past 12
                            months have produced noteworthy improvements in the relations between
                            our countries, highlighted, for example, by our consular relations and
                            by the progress we have made in the economic, scientific and
                            technological fields.</p>
                        <p>Your kind remarks with regard to United States participation in the
                            events celebrating Copernicus' 500th anniversary are also most welcome.
                            It was with great pleasure that I designated the week of April 23, 1973,
                            as Nicolaus Copernicus week, and, more recently, I was pleased to
                            receive from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TW2"
                                >Trampczynski</persName> a commemorative facsimile of Copernicus
                            work.</p>
                        <p>It is my sincere hope, Mr. Secretary, that the months ahead will continue
                            to produce meaningful progress in relations between our countries, not
                            only in bilateral fields of mutual interest but also on significant
                            international issues of importance to both Poland and the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>In this regard, I would note in particular the efforts required to
                            safeguard the peace so dearly won in Vietnam. The most recent
                            negotiations in Paris provide all the parties involved with a renewed
                            and strengthened obligation to abide by and implement the Vietnam
                            accords signed in January. I believe that the wholehearted participation
                            of the International <pb n="4" xml:id="d46-04" facs="d46-04"/>Commission
                            of Control and Supervision is essential to effective implementation of
                            the accords. If Poland is able to demonstrate the impartial supervision
                            and dedicated effort required for the successful performance of the
                            mission of the <gloss target="#t_ICCS1">ICCS</gloss>, you and your
                            countrymen will have the thanks not only of the United States but of all
                            the peoples of the world for your contributions to a lasting peace.</p>
                        <p>Again, your letter is appreciated. I value the opportunity afforded by
                            this correspondence to share these thoughts with you.</p>

                        <p>ACTION</p>
                        <p>February 22, 1974</p>
                        <p>On the assumption that the White House has already approved in principle
                            an official visit by Polish First Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> in 1974, State has forwarded the memorandum at
                            Tab B setting forth tactical options aimed at ensuring that Polish
                            Cardinal Wyszynski does not attempt to block or hamper the visit.</p>
                        <p>State has based its assumption on Polish Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TW2">Trampczynski</persName>'s report of his
                            conversation with you during a State reception on November 29, 1973
                            during which it is reported (Memcon at Tab C) that you informed the
                            Ambassador that the visit would take place during 1974.</p>
                        <p>I believe it would be appropriate to consider a visit by <persName
                                corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> later this year. While we are
                            still at odds with the Poles over their <gloss target="#t_ICCS1"
                                >ICCS</gloss> performance, other aspects of our relations have shown
                            improvement during 1973 --particularly in the work of the trade and
                            science commissions established during the President's 1972 Warsaw
                            visit. As you know, the communique from the visit recorded the Polish
                            leaders' acceptance of the President's invitation to pay a return visit
                            to the United States.</p>
                        <p>The schedule proposal for your signature to the President at Tab A would
                            recommend that he approve an official visit by Polish First Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> during
                            September-November 1974.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the issue of advance consultations with the Catholic church,
                            State believes that the success of the <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> visit will depend in part on the attitude of the
                            Polish/American community and that this attitude will be influenced by
                            the position which Polish Cardinal Wyszynski adopts toward the visit.
                            State accordingly recommends advance consultations with the Cardinal,
                            suggesting that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DRT1">Davies</persName>
                            might take up the issue directly with the Polish Cardinal or that the
                            State Department could ask U. S. Cardinal Krol, who has responsibilities
                            for Polish church matters in the United States, to discuss the <persName
                                corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> visit with Cardinal
                            Wyszynski.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d47-02" facs="d47-02"/>
                        <p>In my opinion once the schedule proposal has been approved for the
                                <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> visit, it would be
                            useful to have advance consultations. However, I believe it would be
                            best to have the White House handle this matter -- perhaps either
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HBMJ1">Haig</persName> as chief of the
                            White House staff or <persName corresp="#p_FPM1">Peter
                                Flanigan</persName> -- with Cardinal Krol. The necessary talking
                            points would be as follows: <list>

                                    of 1974.</item>
                                <item>-- The White House wanted Cardinal Krol to know in the belief
                                    that he might wish to afford Cardinal Wyszynski the courtesy of
                                    notification of the visit in advance of the public
                                    announcement.</item>
                                <item>-- Recalling his very warm and cordial reception in Poland in
                                    1972, it is, of course, the President's hope that First
                                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>'s visit
                                    will be successful.</item>

                        <p>If you agree that the consultations should be handled by the White House
                            along the above lines, we will draft the necessary talking points

                            communique signed by the two leaders, as was done during President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s visit to the United
                            States, would be more appropriate and could be worded more easily to
                            reflect current <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Polish political
                            relations. If the Poles are insistent, however, we could agree to a
                            declaration essentially along the lines of the traditional formulations
                            governing intercourse between states. What they have in mind will be
                            made clearer during the week of September 9-13 in discussions between
                            Department of State officials and a Polish advance team led by Central
                            Committee Secretariat member <persName corresp="#p_FR3"

                        <p>Joint Declaration on Economic, Industrial and Technological Cooperation:
                            This document, general in tone and covering the period between now and
                            1980, is being negotiated during the fourth session of the
                            American-Polish Joint Trade Commission (September 9-10 in Washington) in
                            lieu of a formal long-term agreement. The Commission is expected to
                            propose a text for adoption by both Governments during the <persName
                                corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> visit.</p>
                        <p>Joint Communique: There has been no Polish reaction as yet to our
                            informal proposal that political principles governing relations should
                            be contained in a Joint Communique of the type signed by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Polish leaders on
                            June 1 1972 during the President's trip to Warsaw. It is likely,
                            however, that the Poles will press for a Joint Communique, covering all
                            aspects of the visit and describing future relations, signed by
                            President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> and First
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>. More than
                            likely, this Communique draft will be roughed out during the <persName

                            <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 Postponement: U.S. agencies are
                            now at odds over a Polish request for postponement of about $50 million
                            in dollar payments due to the U.S. for sales of American agricultural
                            commodities to Poland in 1957-64 under <gloss target="#t_PL1"
                            >PL</gloss>-480.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. agreed to a similar deferment for the years 1973-74 following
                            the visit of President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> to
                            Warsaw in 1972.</p>
                        <p>At that time, we invited the Poles to discuss a 1975-77 deferment with us
                            late in 1974. If inter-agency differences cannot be resolved in the next
                            several days, high-level decision on this matter will be sought.</p>
                        <p>Science and Technology Joint Financing (Marie Sklodowska Curie Fund): The
                            Department of State is now awaiting resolution of inter-agency
                            differences as well as a Treasury Department decision on a Polish
                            counterproposal about increasing the size of this Fund, which finances a
                            wide range of joint projects in both countries. Latest indications are
                            that the Poles will meet our desires on modalities providing we increase
                            the amounts designated to be spent through FY 1978. Treasury has been
                            requested to set aside an additional $15 million to be used for energy
                            and energy-related cooperative research. High-level decision will be
                            sought if inter-agency differences cannot be resolved in the near
                            future.</p>
                        <p>Commodity Credit Cooperation (<gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss>)
                            Credits: The Poles have requested $55 million in <gloss target="#t_CCC1"
                                >CCC</gloss> credits for purchases in calendar year 1975 of such
                            items as cotton, barley, corn and tobacco. They are also interested in
                            buying wheat if it becomes available. With the easing of the supply
                            situation for some commodities, a $12 million line of <gloss
                                target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credit for tobacco and cotton has been
                            proposed by Agriculture. The Treasury Department argues that there is no
                            economic justification for a <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credit
                            on cotton. Ex-Im and the Federal Reserve concur with Treasury, while
                            Agriculture, Commerce and State argue in favor. High-level decision may
                            be sought in the near future.</p>

                        <p>Coal Mining and Utilization Agreement: The Poles have proposed that our
                            Interior Department and their Ministry of Mining and Power enter into an
                            agreement for cooperation in coal mining and utilization. An Interior
                            team of experts visited Poland in early August and subsequently proposed
                            areas of possible joint cooperation to the Polish Ministry of Mining and
                            Power. This cooperation would be limited, however, to exchange of
                            information. Polish initial reaction was one of disappointment that the
                            agreement did not contemplate cooperative research, jointly funded by
                            the two governments. (NOTE: Cooperative research would involve, in the
                            first instance, a positive decision on the additional increment to the
                            Marie Sklodowska Curie Fund as set out above.)</p>
                        <p>Gdansk (Danzig) Bonds/Gold: The Poles have asked us to agree to release
                            gold formerly belonging to the pre-war Free State of Danzig
                            administration. (This gold is now under the protection of the
                                U.S.,<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France.) We have agreed
                            in principle to this release but are insisting that Poland must first
                            undertake serious negotiations aimed at settling outstanding claims by
                            U.S. holders of municipal bonds issued by the pre-war Danzig regime. The
                            Poles have resisted a linking of the two issues but are in the process
                            of initiating contact with the Foreign Bondholders Council.</p>
                        <p>Long-Term Agricultural Agreement: This subject is now under discussion in
                            connection with the fourth session of the American-Polish Joint Trade
                            Commission. The Commission will probably recommend an agency-to-agency
                            agreement simply endorsing an expansion of two-way trade in agricultural
                            commodities.</p>
                        <p>Environmental Protection Agreement: Proposed by the United States,
                            negotiation was almost complete when Congressional unwillingness to
                            appropriate necessary <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 funds for
                            this year caused <gloss target="#t_EPA1">EPA</gloss> to review the
                            desirability of the agreement. The Department of State has subsequently
                            informed <gloss target="#t_EPA1">EPA</gloss> that such an agreement
                            would be in the U.S. national interest. Completion of an <gloss

                            shortly.</p>
                        <p>Double Taxation Convention: Negotiation is almost complete, and the

                                corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> of Poland, joint statements on
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Polish political and economic
                            relations have been negotiated for signature by you and the First
                            Secretary during the visit.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Statement on Principles of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>-Polish Relations (Tab A) outlines the fundamental principles
                            governing our bilateral relations (and is in keeping with the spirit of
                            the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Romanian
                            documents already signed).</p>
                        <p>It establishes that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Polish relations
                            are founded on the principles of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Charter and international law -- e. g., sovereign equality, refraining
                            from the threat or use of force, nonintervention in internal affairs and
                            respect for human rights and freedoms. It expresses your determination
                            and that of the First Secretary to develop <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>-Polish relations in a spirit of cooperation and mutual
                            respect, and your determination to cooperate on international issues of
                            common interest.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Statement on the Development of Economic, Industrial and
                            Technological Cooperation (Tab B) endorses further growth in <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Polish Trade, calls for new forms of
                            economic, technological and industrial cooperation, and expresses the
                            agreement of both countries on steps to facilitate the conduct of
                            bilateral business.</p>
                        <p>Both statements will enhance U. S. efforts to improve <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Polish bilateral political and economic
                            relations. Neither statement commits the United States substantially to
                            positions or courses of action beyond our present positions, and neither
                            involves new expenditures of funds. Both statements are of importance to
                            Poland and they will meet First Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName>'s desire to leave Washington with tangible United
                            States interest in Poland as an independent political entity and a
                            respected trading partner. I recommend that you approve the Joint
                            Statements, for signature with First Secretary <persName

                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: In France, the ethnic
                            group of Poles came during the French Revolution. People of Polish
                            extraction have been introduced into many countries.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Then in the 19th
                            Century, the Polish nationalists concluded that the only way they could
                            get independence was to join every war -- individually.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> knows our history very well.
                            In our anthem, it says we have been guided by Bonapartist methods of how
                            to win. We Socialists left it in.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have always been
                            impressed by Warsaw's Old City. It took much pride to restore it that
                            way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: That is true.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d50-02" facs="d50-02"/>
                        <p>President: Let me at the outset welcome you in a personal way. I really
                            look forward to your mission and what has been done to bring us together
                            as peoples and what we can do in the future to expand our contacts.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: Thank you again for the
                            invitation to visit the United States. I appreciate the transmission of
                            the invitation by you. I welcome the evidence of your will to expand
                                Polish-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> relations and detente. I
                            attach importance to our forthcoming talks and I am confident that the
                            meeting will contribute to Polish-American relations. I am confident the
                            meeting will not only strengthen old ties but will build new measures of
                            contacts between us. They will also contribute to the political prestige
                            of our peoples. The great American people have achieved much, and we
                            will be receptive to anything you do which will promote peace.</p>
                        <p>In bilateral matters, I think we are doing very well, and I express my
                            satisfaction with the policy of detente. I am very pleased with the
                            preparations for the visit and the statements to be signed. The
                            contribution of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> and the Department of State are very much
                            appreciated. It has been done in a constructive and favorable atmosphere
                            and will help insure that our talks will be fruitful.</p>
                        <p>My visit is the result of detente. We attach great significance to that
                            process. Poland pursues that policy in the world, and its national
                            interest is to live in security and cooperation in the international
                            world. We are cooperating with the Soviet Union and the Eastern European
                            nations on the principles of mutual cooperation and partnerships. At the
                            moment this socialist cooperation is active in making detente a new
                            profound, peaceful coexistence and deepening international cooperation.
                            The meeting of the <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> in Poland this
                            year worked to make detente irreversible.</p>
                        <p>Likewise with great satisfaction we welcome improved relations between
                            the United States and the Soviet Union. These agreements on substance
                            are of great importance. They are of substantial significance to prevent
                            a new world war. They help extinguish the Cold War and encourage
                            bilateral cooperation between East and West. They promote detente. There
                            are many advantages stemming from <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>-Soviet detente, and we welcome your announcement of its
                            continuation. For as I know from <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> and from my recent conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName>, it is the wish of the Soviet
                            leadership to continue good relations with the United States. I know the
                            Soviet Union very well and the <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> policy enjoys the lasting and profound support
                            of the Soviet Union's allies and us. We support it enthusiastically
                            because it meets vital interests of all Poles.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d50-03" facs="d50-03"/>
                        <p>There is the important question of European Security. From the nature of
                            things, Poland is principally concerned with Europe. We think the
                            situation is favorable. For the first time, the continent is enjoying
                            peace. In the 1,000 years of Polish history, only 200 years were
                            peaceful.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: In isolated
                            intervals.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: That is true. Considering
                            the past and our tense relations, especially that there have been wars,
                            there is now recognition of two German states. I don't know if that is
                            correct, but we want to strengthen the two German states.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I was talking to
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> about the World Cup
                            Soccer championship. Both East and West Germany were playing. I told
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> the worst thing for
                            him would be if East Germany won. He really grinned. Poland got third
                            place. You would have done better than West Germany but for the
                            rain.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: We think we must equalize
                            the disparities in development which earlier existed. We are happy with
                            the positive response to detente in Europe. You were in both wars and
                            now are politically, economically and militarily in Europe. So you are
                            vitally interested and can play a great role. We see the United States
                            as actively involved in the European detente.</p>
                        <p>This is especially true of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
                            Europe. I know you have a positive attitude on that question. We think
                            the situation is ripe for the third phase at the end of this year or
                            early next, at the highest level. We think there should be a permanent
                            organ for consultation and cooperation. The difference of opinion isn't
                            too great.</p>
                        <p>We are also for force reductions in Europe. This is of direct concern to
                            Poland and corresponds to our efforts to reduce tension and
                            confrontation in Eastern Europe.</p>
                        <p>In the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> we think the work should be
                            intensified so there can be an agreement.</p>
                        <p>The postwar period confirmed that changes which took place in Europe were
                            of great international consequence. For example, the creation of the two
                            German states and the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin -- we support
                            these measures toward stabilization. We welcome the establishment of
                            diplomatic relations between the U. S. and <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>. So far as the course of our relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, the Treaty of 1970 established the
                            basis for these relations, but there are still a few questions from the
                            tragic past. One can hardly expect too rapid progress. We have exchanged
                                <pb n="4" xml:id="d50-04" facs="d50-04"/>proposals and are
                            optimistic that there should be a settlement, and I think in the near
                            future my visit to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will be
                            feasible. I have an invitation a year and a half ago from the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. We want to settle these issues as soon
                            as possible. The people who lost six million and their national wealth
                            can't forget, but we don't want to live in the past but build for the
                            future.</p>
                        <p>The Polish position on international affairs is well known. The
                            differences stemming from Vietnam are not easy. We joined the <gloss
                                target="#t_ICCS1">ICCS</gloss> at your insistence.</p>
                        <p>President: We thank you for your participation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We heard of some
                            problems last year. We are interested in your problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: All the parties in Vietnam
                            have something against us. We could not be isolated and yet didn't want
                            to get into conflict with any of the parties. We very seriously felt our
                            policy and the consequences. But we stayed in the Commission in order to
                            contribute to peace, though appearances sometimes may not make it look
                            that way.</p>
                        <p>In the Middle East I repeat what I said to <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> in 1972, that we are in favor of a settlement
                            guaranteeing security to the Arabs and Israel.</p>
                        <p>President: That is important to both.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: We have said that for
                            years, and I confirm it. We need normalization with Israel and we hope
                            for that along with settlement of the Middle East question.</p>
                        <p>We don't think Israel should discriminate against our soldiers as
                            intruders. We are there to maintain guard order and peace and wish
                            Israel would agree to solutions in favor of all the peoples of the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>I read your <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> speech with interest on
                            international economic relations. This is an important problem with
                            political as well as economic significance. I agree that each state is
                            part of the international economic system. We strive for the best system
                            without discrimination. We are willing to participate in all
                            constructive undertakings.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d50-05" facs="d50-05"/>
                        <p>I have only talked about some issues. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> and Minister <persName corresp="#p_OS4"
                                >Olszowski</persName> can take up more of them. I would like to
                            stress our interest in detente and in strengthening it and our
                            relations. This is the only road to consolidate peace and solve world
                            problems. Polish-U.S. cooperation can contribute to detente.</p>
                        <p>Let me talk about Polish-U. S. relations. First, the economic
                            problems.</p>
                        <p>Let me tell you about the development of my country. My plans call for
                            closer cooperation between us. Poland has pursued 30 years of economic
                            effort. The beginning was very difficult. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> and Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> know these very well. Our
                            people over these 30 years have not only defended ourselves and rebuilt,
                            but we have industrialized, have built a democratic-socialist structure,
                            health protection, and rebuilt our intelligentsia which was almost
                            destroyed. This took strenuous effort. We did it by our own strength. We
                            are now 10th in the world in industrial production. Our production
                            increased eight-fold and increases at the average developed-country
                            level. We had 26 million people in 1945; we now have 34 million. We have
                            behind us the “takeoff operation” and we are in a qualitatively new
                            phase, characterized by high economic growth, modernization of the
                            economy, and higher standards of living. Our <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                                >GNP</gloss> is growing by 9 1/2%. Income will have increased about
                            35% given stable food prices.</p>
                        <p>Our desire is to continue this growth rate in the next five-year plan.
                            Poland has raw materials for the growth of agriculture and industry. Our
                            balance of payments is good. We are reaping the benefit of the previous
                            investment. One-hundred and five establishments were started this year.
                            Next year we plan more.</p>
                        <p>Of great importance is the expansion of cooperation with foreign
                            countries. The Soviet Union is building a 10-million ton steel mill.
                            Next year they will give us 50 investment projects. We have projects
                            with France and Great Britain. We want to strengthen our credit and help
                            ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Our strategy is aimed at strengthening Poland. We have a good position
                            among the socialist states and it is growing. A strong, independent
                            Poland is needed for Europe and perhaps the world. This is the starting
                            point for expansion of U. S.-Polish relations. We want the U. S. to have
                            the leading role in expansion of our economic-cooperation with the West.
                            We will present <pb n="6" xml:id="d50-06" facs="d50-06"/>proposals. We
                            have built a structure of closer ties -- the Joint Trade Commission,
                            Ex-Im Bank loans, more contracts with U. S. banks and concerns. We want
                            to broaden contacts and the Joint Commission plays a great role, and it
                            could be even enhanced.</p>
                        <p>This progress we think is only the harbinger of greater cooperation and
                            progress. The agreement we reached here will help. We anticipate a
                            substantial increase in trade. In three years it went from $250 to $500
                            million and to $1 billion this year. By 1980 we expect it will be $2
                            billion. We want to buy investment equipment. Our new five-year plan
                            gives to special purchases in the U. S. up to $1 billion. We are
                            developing cooperation among industries and already have it with
                            International Harvester and others. We have a big undertaking with
                            General Motors. These proposals are linked closely with favorable credit
                            terms. Ex-Im credit terms are important, but not sufficient for our
                            plans. We need private credit but the interest is too high now. I will
                            request greater U. S. Government credit.</p>
                        <p>President: I look forward to receiving your proposal.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: I think especially for the
                            long-term undertaking our proposals will be good.</p>
                        <p>Agricultural crop cooperation is another area. You spoke of food problems
                            and cooperation in agriculture. Poland has been a permanent and stable
                            purchaser of U. S. surplus agricultural products. We want to continue,
                            and we would like a guarantee for the annual purchase of one or one and
                            one-half million tons of grain and more of other produce. We will submit
                            a long-term agreement for such purchases. We are a traditional customer,
                            and perhaps can get <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credit. We would
                            like a postponement of the <gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 480
                            repayments. I request favorable consideration of our proposal. We want
                            to broaden cooperation in food production. Our program for Poland calls
                            for considerable modernization for import consumption and also for
                            export. Today's agreement should be only an introduction to a broader
                            agreement on foodstuffs. We would like access to your
                            accomplishments.</p>
                        <p>Also important are the coal agreements we will sign -- the agreements on
                            coal processing and gasification, on scientific and technical
                            cooperation, on agriculture and health protection are especially
                            important. Our agreements will strengthen these links and allow for
                            expansion. This kind of <pb n="7" xml:id="d50-07" facs="d50-07"
                            />cooperation represents a special interest for us and will help
                            consolidate the west in U. S. -Polish cooperation.</p>
                        <p>We also believe we can inject new dynamism into our economic relations
                            generally and with nations of the West, and that it would help overcome
                            the current difficulty in the world economy.</p>
                        <p>We are trying to cooperate in all fields of endeavor and expanding the
                            contacts of our citizens with other countries.</p>
                        <p>I want to express great satisfaction with the support from your
                            government on these questions.</p>
                        <p>There are many Americans of Polish extraction. In the majority of cases
                            they contribute to Polish-U.S. relations. We proceed from the premise
                            that American Poles should be good American citizens, and it would be
                            desirable for us if they could maintain a sentimental feeling for their
                            ancestral land. They can contribute to mutual understanding, and we have
                            no other interest in this respect. The many letters I get support the
                            development of U. S.-Polish relations. We in Poland have always
                            cherished great hopes for American Poles and other foreign Poles,
                            because it was due to their influence that President Wilson in 1918 put
                            the question of Polish independence.</p>
                        <p>These are the principal questions which we think are the base of U.S. -
                            Polish cooperation. We should open a new stage of that cooperation so we
                            can be increasingly dynamic and strengthen detente. We hope you have
                            similar views. This visit and the climate of cooperation helps maintain
                            and preserve the links of traditional friendship and kinship.</p>
                        <p>I convey my personal invitation and that of my government and people to
                            visit Poland. It would be of great significance for our relations and
                            detente.</p>
                        <p>We send our best wishes for a speedy recovery to Mrs. <persName

                        <p>President: I remember my visit in about 1958 as a member of an
                            inter-Parliamentary delegation. We visited mostly in Warsaw, but we
                            spent some time elsewhere. It was very interesting, and I do want to
                            come back. We will discuss when it is possible, but I really want to do
                            it.</p>

                            the bottom of our hearts. We have a saying “the house gives everything

                        <p>President: You treated President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName> with great warmth and I know from American Poles
                            the kind of reception I would get. We will make a maximum effort.</p>
                        <p>I was very interested to hear your discussion of detente, international
                            relations, and our bilateral relations.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> played a big role
                            in putting American-Polish relations and our relations with the Soviet
                            Union on a better basis. We hope to expand these relations as much as
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>We think Poland and all other countries on both sides benefit from
                            detente. In Europe, it was in the interest of East and West to have a
                            Conference on Security and Cooperation. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> says it is moving along. We
                            are not in a position to pick a day, but its consummation will enhance
                            the prospects for peace. We are grateful for your comments on the Middle
                            East. A year ago the fourth war broke out, and brought much losses and
                            damage. We want to work with both sides to prevent another outbreak. You
                            know Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> is
                            leaving tonight on another Middle East trip, showing that we will do all
                            we can to get a just and lasting peace. I agree we want peace and
                            protection for both sides. If we can work together, hopefully we can
                            make a contribution.</p>
                        <p>I was pleased with your account of the economic, political and cultural
                            progress in U. S. -Polish relations over the past ten years. The
                            agreements we will sign are good for both of us, and lay the basis for
                            further expansion. We believe the expansion of trade is vital for
                            detente and the economies of both sides. We are trying to get the Trade
                            Bill through, and what Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> has said would help with Congressional
                            concerns. We see progress and hope for a bill with <gloss
                                target="#t_MFN1">MFN</gloss> -- which you already have.</p>
                        <p>I am interested in your proposal for a long-term agricultural purchase
                            program. We will study your proposals to see what can be done in that
                            regard.</p>
                        <p>On <gloss target="#t_MBFR1">MBFR</gloss>, we would be pleased if it could
                            be jointly supported. Our delegation is there to try for an agreement
                            that is in the best interests of the U. S. and Soviet Union and the
                            allies of both. We hope for progress.</p>

                        <p>The Polish people in the U. S. have made a tremendous contribution to
                            art, science, culture, etc. In my town there are 40,000 American Poles,
                            so I know first hand.</p>
                        <p>The things they have done have made the U. S. a better place to live.
                            Those activities will continue to make Poland a strong country in every
                            way.</p>
                        <p>I look forward to continuing these talks and taking up the details, and

                        <p>SECRETARY: The First Secretary and the President had an interesting
                            meeting in which they reviewed the state of our relations in a <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d51-02" facs="d51-02"/>constructive and positive spirit.
                            These discussions will continue before and after dinner this evening. We
                            attach great importance to this visit. We recognize the state of your
                            existing relations and we know the realities of geography and history
                            and what they meant to the Poles and Poland. We do not believe, however,
                            that there is anything inconsistent between these realities and an
                            improvement in relations between Poland and the United States. It is in
                            this spirit that we approach your visit, Mr. First Secretary.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: I can only add that all
                            the things I have said conform with our vital interests and our sincere
                            intent to develop friendly relations with the United States. We know our
                            place and we know what our situation is. It is precisely because we do
                            know these things that we feel we can contribute more to developing
                            co-existence and to the lasting friendship we have with the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: We appreciate very much the contribution that Poland has made
                            to helping to solve problems in the Middle East and in Viet-Nam. We
                            recognize the special problem you have in Viet-Nam and the difficulty
                            you face in saying certain things publicly but I must tell you frankly
                            that a resumption of hostilities in Viet-Nam would complicate our
                            relations. We would have to draw the conclusion that the flow of Soviet
                            equipment had caused this resumption of hostilities and this would have
                            a serious effect on detente. We don't want public statements from
                            you.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_OS4">OLSZOWSKI</persName>: I will have several
                            matters to discuss with you concerning the International Control
                            Commission. We do not think there should be a change in status but there
                            are certain things that could be done which would help.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: We would look on any suggestions with an open mind. Anything
                            that can be done which would complicate military operations we would
                            favor.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: Our desire is to make
                            certain concrete suggestions which possibly might hamper the growth of
                            hostilities in the area. We wish to tell you, however, that it is a
                            difficult problem for us.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: We appreciate very much the willingness of Poland to stay in
                            the <gloss target="#t_ICCS1">ICCS</gloss>. We recognize that Poland has

                            cases of malaria.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: It's one of the few places the Poles can catch malaria.</p>
                        <p>Which problem is of the greatest concern to you in the political or other
                            international field?</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: For us in Poland the prime

                        <p>SECRETARY: By the way, I am doing a sociological survey to determine
                            which Foreign Minister has read all of the <gloss target="#t_CSCE1"

                            are not prepared, however, to jeopardize our relationship with our

                            might personally be inclined to go along with the position, we will not
                            urge our European allies to do this. But even with that qualification. I
                            believe that the conference can be concluded the first part of next
                            year.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: This would be an
                            achievement for peace in this part of the world but it would also have
                            good effects in other parts as well.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: The major issues seem to be in connection with the principles
                            on the specific language dealing with “peaceful change”. This is
                            primarily a problem between the Federal Republic and the Soviet
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: And us.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: We have no frontiers we want to change.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: We don't either.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d51-05" facs="d51-05"/>
                        <p>SECRETARY: It is not our impression that this problem will be difficult
                            to solve. There is also the question of <gloss target="#t_CBM1"
                                >CBM</gloss>s and Basket III. Here the difficulty seems to be that
                            the documents are accumulating. We are trying to reduce the 13 or 14
                            proposals to one document that can be negotiated. Our allies, however,
                            want to go through the process of a first reading. We support a first
                            reading and when it is concluded we will attempt to get a single
                            position that can be negotiated. Personally, I believe that the
                            Communists will not change their regimes without noticing it. It's a
                            good idea to have these exchanges of persons and ideas. But that does
                            not seem to us a major area of difficulty. My impression is that the
                            conference can be successfully concluded early in 1975.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OS4">OLSZOWSKI</persName>: One matter of concern
                            is that the fall session in Geneva seemed to start smoothly but quickly
                            came to a standstill.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: That couldn't have been a very smooth beginning then.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OS4">OLSZOWSKI</persName>: I agree, but there are
                            too many problems and they must be reduced. We must seek to elaborate
                            what is on the table. In Basket I the key is the principle of the
                            inviolability of frontiers and that seems to be on the way to agreement.
                            Basket II also seems near completion. On Basket III we think it would be
                            worthwhile to take a realistic look at what is acceptable. As far as
                            Polish practice is concerned, there are no <pb n="6" xml:id="d51-06"
                                facs="d51-06"/>serious obstacles for us. Looking realistically there
                            should be proposals that both sides can accept if we select the
                            proposals carefully. In fact, this brings us to the last question which
                            is the post-conference body. Perhaps we could select some formulas to
                            agree on now and leave others for the continuing machinery to work out
                            later.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: As far as Basket III is
                            concerned there are 13 to 15 million people who visit Poland each year
                            (sic). Sixty to eighty percent are from the West--Scandinavia, Germany,
                            France, etc. We will have several tens of thousands of Americans. We
                            have no objection to that. In addition, 8 million (sic) Poles visit
                            outside Poland--in Czechoslovakia, France, Scandinavia and even
                            Spain.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: I don't think Poland will have difficulty with this area but
                            what about the Soviets?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: It is true there may be
                            some difficulties for them.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: We approach this whole matter in a constructive spirit. We
                            don't wish to push these matters in a way that will humiliate the Soviet
                            Union. After the first reading we will try to find some compromises. The
                            authors of these proposals need a first reading to satisfy their pride.
                            As far as the United States is concerned, we could do it either way.
                            This is a procedural issue and once we have settled it we can then move
                            toward a conclusion. On the inviolability issue, if you want my honest
                            view, only <pb n="7" xml:id="d51-07" facs="d51-07"/>the lawyers
                            understand the differences between the various formulations on peaceful
                            change. No one is going to be able to change a frontier by pointing to a
                            paragraph in the <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss> Declaration. The
                            main issue now seems to be over the placement of the word “only”. The
                            West Germans have a difficult domestic policy issue. We have told the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the Soviets to work it out.
                            We have no quarrel with the old registered text or with the new text.
                            The problem, Chuck (turning to Senator Percy), is that the German
                            lawyers feel that the phrase “only under international law can frontiers
                            be changed peacefully” means nothing because international law has
                            nothing to say about changing frontiers and, therefore, they want a
                            phrase “according to international law frontiers can only be changed
                            peacefully and by agreement.”</p>
                        <p>SENATOR PERCY: If I could ask a slightly different question. We are now
                            discussing in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> the Mexican proposal
                            for a Charter of Rights and Duties between developed and less developed
                            countries. This could deal with the question of raw materials, indexing,
                            expropriation, etc. There is one position taken by Algeria and India and
                            another by the developed countries. Yugoslavia seems to be closer to the
                            developed countries' side. It ought to be possible to bring these
                            positions together and reconcile the differences.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OS4">OLSZOWSKI</persName>: That is a very
                            interesting subject but may I go back to the other subject for a moment.
                            On the <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss> it is not only the Soviets
                            who have difficulty with <pb n="8" xml:id="d51-08" facs="d51-08"/>Basket
                            III. There are others as well. For example, the Turks are not happy with
                            some of the proposals for exchange of information.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: You mean the Turks want to oppose Basket III because they
                            don't want newspapers to come in?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OS4">OLSZOWSKI</persName>: That seems to be the
                            problem. Now to turn to Senator Percy's question. We have carefully
                            studied this matter and we think it is of great international concern
                            but we don't believe that advances will be made quickly. The world
                            economy is much more complicated than it was six months ago. What might
                            have been soluble then is no longer easily settled. You have the
                            question of sovereign rights over resources. We agree on the principles
                            but it is the practical solution that is difficult. Summarizing briefly,
                            we will use all means to make a contribution but we might have
                            difficulty undertaking an obligation to the conciliation procedure.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: I have generally supported this proposal but there are many
                            aspects which we cannot accept and I agree with you that it will take a
                            lengthy negotiation. President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1"
                                >Ford</persName> will soon meet with President Echeverria. I am sure
                            we will hear from him about this Charter. Have you been to Mexico?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: This is the first time I
                            have visited this hemisphere. I have traveled widely in Asia.</p>
                        <pb n="9" xml:id="d51-09" facs="d51-09"/>
                        <p>SECRETARY: To China?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: Yes, and I have been to
                            Viet-Nam, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia--all over Asia. In Europe I have
                            been to every country with the exception of Portugal and I hope soon to
                            go there.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Do you think they will join the Warsaw Pact soon?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: We would certainly give
                            serious consideration to that but, as you know, in the Warsaw Pact there
                            are both privileges and duties that must be accepted. So far, however,
                            there has been no such development. The Soviet Union is only one of the
                            members. We would all have our own opinion.</p>
                        <p>ZABLOCKI: Do all the members of the Warsaw Pact have an equal voice?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OS4">OLSZOWSKI</persName>: As concerns Portugal,
                            it might be better for them to start with COMECON.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_FR3">FRELEK</persName>: Yes, the Portuguese have
                            an economic problem.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: We may yet have a situation in which Portugal is a member both
                            of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact. Do you
                            think that would advance European security?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OS4">OLSZOWSKI</persName>: That could be Basket
                            IV.</p>
                        <p>JAGIELSKI: That would certainly be a new experience.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_OS4">OLSZOWSKI</persName>: They have made speeches
                            and public statements saying that they consider the conference
                            disgusting.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Going back to our bilateral relations, I believe that they are
                            good. All these agreements that we are going to sign are good.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: About Albania, I can say
                            that they are unreservedly critical of us Poles. They accuse us of being
                            servants of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> world imperialism.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: I want you to know that we consider this to be a significant
                            visit. Poland and the United States have a history of friendship which
                            is good.</p>
                        <p>Now, Mr. First Secretary, this is a working lunch and not a protocol
                            occasion. But I want you to know how warmly we welcome you here. What
                            other country conceived the idea that it should fight for the freedom of
                            others so that it could win its own freedom? Wherever freedom was fought
                            for, Poles were present during the 150 years of its national tragedy. We
                            recognize reality and that existing friendships will be maintained. In
                            that spirit we are prepared to deepen relations between Poland and the
                            United States. We all remember our 1972 visit with memories of the
                            friendly reception we received at that time. I would like to propose a
                            toast to the First Secretary and to Polish-American friendship.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: I would like to respond to
                            the very kind words you have just expressed. I <pb n="11"
                                xml:id="d51-11" facs="d51-11"/>would like to speak here on behalf of
                            the Polish Government and people, as well as to reflect my own personal
                            experience. I am the son of a man who before World War I was a member of
                            the Polish Socialist Party and who was a Polish patriot. I was brought
                            up in an atmosphere of great patriotism. I spent 22 years abroad in
                            France and Belgium. I was very active in the Resistance against the
                            Germans. The whole course of my life was changed by that experience.
                            Although I am a Communist, I have always had a special idea of Poland
                            and what it should represent. After World War II I could have stayed in
                            the West as many others did. But I returned to Poland with my family
                            because I believed that every pair of hands, every mind and every brain,
                            was necessary to help rebuild Poland. We also remember those who began
                            immediately after World War II to rebuild Warsaw, Wroclaw, Szczecin. We
                            Poles believe it is necessary to bring our country to an ever higher
                            level of standard of living. Everything that we are doing
                            now--Communists and all others--is necessary to build up our country. I
                            am not saying this to create a sentimental atmosphere but rather because
                            I want you to understand that we need our traditional friends as well as
                            our present allies. The TV transmission of my arrival was received in
                            Poland with great applause because our people believe they need
                            friendship with the United States of America, its great traditional
                            friend. Therefore, I wish to drink a toast to the traditional friendship
                            of Poland and America.</p>

                        <p>SECRETARY: Now you can tell me all about the football results in
                            Poland.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: What was your position on
                            the team?</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: I was goalie and those were very high-scoring games. I can
                            tell you that the Germans are not known for their natural sense of
                            humor. When I was in Munich for the World Cup matches, I made a
                            statement that I was there to improve our consultations with the Federal
                            Republic and that I would follow the Foreign Minister even to the
                            football game to improve our consultations. This was taken very
                            seriously by the German press. When I spoke about my own record as a
                            goalie and the high-scoring games, the German press interpreted this as
                            a very subtle criticism of the defensive tactics of the German football
                            teams. I told <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> that there
                            would have been a great problem if the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> had beaten the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            because it would have built up their self-confidence well beyond the
                            limits of the <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: I can tell you what the
                            attitude of Polish fans is--let them Germans fight.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: There is something about the style of football which reflects
                            national character. I like the Polish style of attack. In fact, the two
                            teams I liked best were Poland and Holland.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: It is true they played
                            very well but, unfortunately, our team dropped its guard after the World
                            Cup.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: When I was seeing the Dutch play against Brazil there was a
                            man sitting next to <pb n="13" xml:id="d51-13" facs="d51-13"/>me and I
                            later found out that he was the Chairman of the Brazilian Football
                            Association. When the Brazilians lost they blamed it on me because they
                            claimed I was impolite to him. I was in Rio in 1962 when they won the
                            World Cup and the fans practically burned the place down. They had a
                            carnival for two days.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OS4">OLSZOWSKI</persName>: After we defeated
                            Italy, they demonstrated in front of our Embassy in Rome.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName>: Yes, we were very worried
                            that it was going to have a negative influence on our relations.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: You know they had a war in Central America between El Salvador
                            and Honduras that started after a football match. In 1945 I was
                            stationed in Nuremberg and it was a tradition that when they lost they
                            beat up the umpire. At that time the German police were not allowed to
                            carry arms and so they had no way to rescue the umpire. The American
                            Military Police had to do the job for them. A big Bavarian got up in the
                            stands and shouted “So that's the democracy you brought us.”</p>
                        <p>SENATOR PERCY: I hope you are not going to announce any grain purchases
                            during your visit.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Not until after the elections. Mr. First Secretary, I think we
                            now have to witness the signing of some agreements.</p>

                        <p>PLACE: The Residence</p>
                        <p>The White House</p>
                        <p>President: This is where they used to have Cabinet meetings. This is the
                            table Lincoln used.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: We are restoring a castle
                            in Warsaw that was destroyed by the Nazis in 1939. It has great symbolic
                            value. We can't invite you there but we have another which housed
                            President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> -- the Wilanow
                            Palace. It was given to the king who was fighting the Turks at Vilnius,
                            and he won. The Turks still complain about that.</p>
                        <p>Once again, let me give you my thanks for your assurances and your
                            sympathy to me and my friends and your friendly attitude towards my
                            people. You and all Americans understand Polish affairs. Roosevelt said
                            at Potsdam or Yalta that Poland should be strong, and that strong means
                            influential and having a greater chance to influence for good.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d52-02" facs="d52-02"/>
                        <p>Home affairs are developing well in Poland. We have good attitudes among
                            the people. We would like to use the coming years for the improvement of
                            housing to a greater extent. There is still a 7-8 year wait for an
                            apartment.</p>
                        <p>President: Still that much.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: Unfortunately, Recently we
                            have done a lot on the question of the well being of people -- helping
                            women and children -- but we still are dissatisfied. Conditions are
                            still worse than in other countries -- but t don't mean to belittle our
                            accomplishments.</p>
                        <p>President: I know from my visit that you came up from total
                            devastation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: I talked to some of your
                            Secretaries today and appealed for a friendly attitude in the affairs in
                            which we are interested. We want nothing free -- we can afford to pay
                            back. We are a solid partner. We need something in advance in certain
                            cases. For example, we have a lot of raw materials. Surely in 5-6 years,
                            we can exploit these by ourselves. We can do it faster with American
                            capital. We return everything back with the produce which is
                            produced.</p>
                        <p>President: Will you take private capital?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: Of course. First National
                            City Bank is helping with our copper industry and takes the returns in
                            copper. We give them a guarantee. It is the same with Rockefeller and
                            Chase Manhattan. We have much coal, lignite. We shall expand the Polish
                            energy industry.</p>
                        <p>President: Is it clean coal or is it difficult?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: The cleanest in Europe.
                            There is no environment problem.</p>
                        <p>President: Are they deep mines?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: They average 700-800
                            meters. We have reserves for 400-500 years. We are interested in the
                            exporting of coal. The one condition is that with our existing
                            production capacity we couldn't increase our exports. In 1975 our
                            production is committed. So only in '76 and after can we do it.</p>
                        <p>We also have much sulfur, zinc, lead.</p>
                        <p>So our proposals are based on our solid evaluation of our potential.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d52-03" facs="d52-03"/>
                        <p>President: You want investment in all these areas?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: Sure. Along the principles
                            we already have with American companies.</p>
                        <p>Then there is the matter of American know-how. I know some things you
                            can't make available, but I would appreciate your review of the embargo
                            list.</p>
                        <p>President: I will certainly try. We will try to coordinate with you what
                            might be helpful to both of us. What in particular do you have in
                            mind?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: There are several areas:
                            chemicals, electronics.</p>
                        <p>President: Computers?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: Parts. Integrated

                            all others, but we hope your confidence will gradually extend to us.</p>
                        <p>President: I hope that will increasingly be possible.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: There are several other
                            things I would like to raise. Our conversations with the FRG. We
                            discussed this with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> and he promised help. The <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should meet our suggestions half-way.
                            What is involved is that we have to have satisfaction to our people --
                            indemnification to our people who were in concentration camps, the fees
                            which the Germans took from the Poles for “insurance.” The Germans have
                            returned to other countries.</p>
                        <p>President: To all others?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: Perhaps also to the Soviet
                            Union. I have mentioned to Brandt that I can't go if I am not sure I can
                            return to tell my people I have taken care of it. Otherwise people will
                            say, “Why did you go?”</p>
                        <p>President: How much does it amount to?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: Not much. It is
                            symbolic.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_OS4">Olszowski</persName>: According to us the sum
                            to be returned is 600 million marks in indemnities, plus 700-800
                            million.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The Deputy Prime
                            Minister and I signed a historic double taxation agreement. I have no

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I thought that when

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The distance between
                            Warsaw and Bonn is greater than that between Warsaw and Washington.</p>
                        <p>President: This has been very helpful. We will discuss it and be in
                            touch.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: I have one more question.
                            Wouldn't it be advisable that if there are any questions where we need
                            assistance, could we write a personal letter?</p>
                        <p>President: Of course.</p>

                        <p>A. Background: Developments in Poland. First Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>'s position as leader of the
                            Polish United Worker's Party and Polish state appears to be unchallenged
                            domestically and fully accepted by Moscow. The riots of December 1970
                            which brought <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> to power also
                            compelled him to adopt policies designed to raise the country's standard
                            of living. <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> is generally
                            credited with the considerable successes which have been achieved in
                            this effort. There are, however, some signs of pending problems of
                            undetermined magnitude for the Polish leadership, basically because of
                            rising expectations and inadequate economic productivity.</p>
                        <p>Consumer goods shortages, especially meat, led to public protests in
                            March. Public apologies by top Party officials, including <persName
                                corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> himself, underlined the great
                            sensitivity of the leadership to public opinion, as well as the short
                            fuse of Poland's workers. As a result, <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> hurriedly pushed up implementation of a profound
                            reorganization of the country's regional and county administrations. The
                            major impact of these changes is on predominantly agricultural areas,
                            permitting closer supervision from the central authorities and ensuring
                            the disappearance of a layer of administration prone to obstructionism
                            and localism.</p>
                        <p>Poland has run up sizable debts over the past several years. Trade with
                            the United States, Western Europe and Japan has switched from a surplus
                            in 1972 to an approximately $1.5 billion annual deficit in 1974-75, and
                            hard currency indebtedness may reach $7 billion by 1976. The Poles also
                            face an economic squeeze, perhaps less so than other Eastern European
                            countries, from increased Soviet oil and other raw-materials prices. A
                            strong trading position with the West enhances the Poles' ability to
                            absorb these price increases.</p>
                        <p>These subterranean uncertainties define the strategic setting of
                                <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>'s reception of you: he
                            will be seeking to strengthen further his position at home and abroad
                            and he will be looking for further U. S. support for his policies. This
                            support will be solicited within the context of Moscow's continuing
                            concern, in the era of detente, for the political and ideological
                            reliability of its Eastern European allies.</p>

                        <p>For the Poles, detente has given new impetus to their testing of the
                            limits of Soviet tolerance in Eastern Europe. It has allowed them to
                            reach out more openly to the West, representing their actions as part of
                            the over-all detente process. Your visit to Warsaw will be an important
                            event in this process for the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s
                            largest East European ally. Since the war, Poland has had a special
                            place in Soviet calculations by virtue of her size, location athwart the
                            traditional invasion route from Germany, and the potential for
                            self-reliance which possession of key raw materials (e.g., coal, copper,
                            sulphur) gives her.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> has used the positive
                            environment of detente in a cautious fashion to stay in power and to
                            promote economic growth. He hopes that higher real incomes, foreign
                            credits, massive imports of Western technology and social and political
                            peace will increase economic productivity and make his country's
                            economic growth self-sustaining. Expanding contacts with the West in the
                            detente framework are the key to the success of these policies, and his
                            visit to the United States and his recent reception of French President
                            Giscard d'Estaing have encouraged him to believe that his strategy is a
                            fruitful and prudent one for Poland.</p>

                            relations. The <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> visit of
                            last October has produced an exceptional atmosphere of good will and
                            cooperation across the board. The United States receives a better press
                            in Poland than in any other Eastern European country. Visits of ranking
                            Polish and American officials continue to be frequent and productive.
                            Since <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>'s visit, seven
                            cabinet-level GOP officials have come to the U. S. and a much greater
                            number of prominent Americans have traveled to Poland. Most of the
                            ranking Americans who have been to Warsaw in 1975 have been personally
                            received by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>.
                            Improvement in bilateral economic ties continues at a very fast
                            pace.</p>
                        <p>Since October, the U. S. has concluded five bilateral agreements with
                            Poland (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480 debt deferral, payments to
                            U. S. annuitants resident in Poland, fisheries - 2, textiles), and the
                            Poles have reached settlement with U. S. holders of pre-war Polish

                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Polish Trade. The volume of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Polish trade has grown four-fold in the
                            1970's from $166 million in 1970 to $660 million in 1974; the commodity
                            structure has become increasingly diversified; and the areas and
                            complexity of commercial relations have expanded. Rising exchanges of
                            industrial goods, together with stable trade in traditional agricultural
                            products, can be expected to boost 1975 trade to over $800 million.
                            Cooperation between American and Polish firms is expanding, as witnessed
                            by the number of American companies opening offices in Warsaw and
                            working on projects in various parts of Poland. Successful conclusion of
                            the various contracts currently being negotiated would assure
                            achievement of the goals set last October for trade turnovers of $1
                            billion in 1976 and $2 billion in 1980. These economic ties with the U.
                            S. play an important role in the Poles' ambitious plans for rapid
                            development and modernization of their economy. They are particularly
                            concerned about access to U. S. markets for their exports and access to
                            U. S. financing for the capital goods and technology which they wish to
                            import from the U. S. The one cloud over <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>-Polish trade, according to First Secretary <persName

                            currently pending against Polish Melex golf carts. Expansion of economic
                            ties supports U.S. policy objectives with regard to Poland and creates
                            new business and jobs for American industry.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Polish Scientific Cooperation.
                            Scientific and technological cooperation with Poland began in the early
                            1960's when U. S. Government agencies entered into arrangements with the
                            Polish Government which permitted Polish institutions to perform
                            research for U. S. agencies using <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>-owned zlotys under the Special Foreign Currency Program
                                (<gloss target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss>-480).</p>
                        <p>Faced with the prospect of having exhausted the supply of excess zlotys
                            by 1973, the U. S. and Poland conducted prolonged negotiations to work
                            out a joint financing arrangement and to extend the program. These talks
                            culminated in an “Agreement Between the Government of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USA1">USA</gloss> and the Government of the Polish
                            People's Republic on Funding of Cooperation in Science and Technology”,
                            signed in Washington on October 8, 1974. The Agreement provides for the
                            creation of the Marie Sklodowska Curie Fund totaling approximately $55
                            million in zlotys to be used for joint research and related activities,
                            with about $20 million of that amount to be used for energy or
                            energy-related research. On the same date, cooperative agreements were
                            signed in the fields of coal research, the health sciences, and the
                            environment.</p>

                            negotiations served occasionally as the principal Warsaw Pact spokesmen
                            on <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss> issues of sensitivity to
                            Moscow, perhaps calculating that such service is a small price to pay
                            for obtaining latitude from Moscow on issues of greater significance to
                            Polish national interests. The Poles have shown genuinely keen interest
                            in the <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss> principles of “frontier
                            inviolability” and “peaceful change of borders” -- which relate directly
                            to formulations in their 1970 treaty with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> formalizing the German-Polish border. They have also
                            enthusiastically supported increased East-West economic ties.</p>
                        <p>On freer movement issues, the Poles have supported the Soviets, arguing
                            that increased human contacts should be developed bilaterally, rather
                            than through <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss>. On post-<gloss

                            agreed to a compromise involving a probationary period until 1977, when
                            a meeting of senior officials will review implementation of all <gloss

                            members have enjoyed a tactical advantage during the recent round of
                            negotiations in Vienna. The East has ascribed lack of progress in the
                            negotiations to Western inflexibility and continued its tactics of
                            attempting to create the impression of Eastern flexibility without
                            changing any of the basic elements of its position. Eastern negotiators
                            have also attempted to capitalize on the unwillingness of the Federal
                            Republic of Germany to specify in advance its military reductions in
                            Phase II and thereby put <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> on the
                            defensive. They have steadily focused on the need to include nuclear

                            nuclear/tank trade might be of interest.</p>

                        <p>The President: Is it permissible to smoke?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: Yes, I think so. This is a
                            painting by Matejko. It depicts a meeting of the Polish parliament on
                            May 3, 1791. That was the date on which the Constitution was adopted.
                            This painting is the story of that event.</p>
                        <p>The President: That is about the same time our Congress first met.</p>
                        <p>(The press leaves.)</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: There was a period when
                            any Polish leader who wished to veto a proposal raised his hand and the
                            proposal was finished. People speak of that period of Polish history as
                            a period when true democracy flourished. But the question is: Was that
                            really democracy or anarchy?</p>
                        <p>Mr. President, I would like once again on behalf of myself and the Polish
                            Government and State to express my heartfelt satisfaction with your
                            visit to Poland. I am convinced that you can feel the sympathy and
                            respect which the Polish people have for the people of the United States
                            and for you personally. Also, I would like to say again that my wife and
                            I recall with great pleasure our visit to the United States. I recall my
                            talks with you and your collaborators and I saw evidence in the United
                            States of friendship for the Polish people. Your visit takes place at a
                            time of particularly intensive development of United States-Polish
                            relations and this makes me very happy. Our exchange of views will
                            provide a new stimulus for the future development of relations as well
                            as for peaceful cooperation on an international plane. For many
                            important reasons, your visit, Mr. President, is of paramount
                            importance. It seems to me that it comes about at the proper time. My
                            colleagues and I regret that it is such a short visit. I would like to
                            have acquainted you with more of our achievements and with all that the
                            Polish people have accomplished. With your permission, Mr. President, I
                            propose, before we discuss Soviet-Polish-American relations, that I
                            inform you briefly about developments in Poland.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d54-04" facs="d54-04"/>
                        <p>The President: I would be very glad to hear you make that
                            presentation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: Your visit, Mr. President,
                            is taking place in a year in which we are finishing our five-year
                            program of economic development. We are now preparing a new program,
                            1976-1980. The balance sheet of the five-year plan which we are
                            finishing is tremendous. During this period, we are achieving production
                            growth of 70%. Growth in agriculture is more than 20%. We are increasing
                            national income by about 60%. We are making a great investment effort.
                            We are making very great efforts for the expansion of modern branches of
                            industry, including raw materials, electrical engineering, ship
                            building, food industry and light industry. As a result of these
                            accomplishments we are achieving important social results. The growth of
                            employment in the national economy will be increased by 1,800,000
                            people. During the current five-year plan, we have as salaried employees
                            more than 11 million people in industries and services. Real wages will
                            have grown by 40%. Equally high is the growth of the incomes of the
                            rural population. I want to tell you that along with these achievements,
                            during this five-year plan we are maintaining the same prices for basic
                            foodstuffs. This is not easy for us. There are some problems, in the
                            first place, concerning meat supplies. Consumption during this five-year
                            plan has grown by 17 kilograms (more than 34 pounds) per capita. In
                            other words, we are reaching our target of 70 kilograms per capita.
                            Naturally, this is not the American standard, but if we consider that we
                            have achieved in one five-year plan a growth of 17 kilograms, this
                            points to the great effort which our State has taken and is still
                            taking. On the subject of difficulties, the growth of wages and other
                            incomes accounts for much greater demands for all kinds of market
                            products. This we are trying to solve. These efforts of ours are not
                            without difficulties. Our people have had a long period of hard work and
                            sacrifices. They have had to build Poland up after tremendous war
                            damage. Naturally, there are possibilities for us to improve the
                            situation. We do it and strive for it but not without difficulties.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d54-05" facs="d54-05"/>
                        <p>Our present speedy development is linked with the dynamic growth of
                            foreign trade. This is true of all directions of our foreign trade. It
                            is true of trade with the Soviet Union, the socialist countries, and
                            economic exchanges with the West. The growth of oil prices, chemical
                            semi-production and other raw materials, machinery and other equipment,
                            result in quite definite difficulties faced by our economy. We can also
                            feel the effects of increases in prices in the West which accounts for
                            nearly half of our foreign trade. I believe the situation will improve
                            due to some advances in the relationships of certain goods which we
                            export. We are now working on the main directions of our new five-year
                            plan which in the fall we will present to all our people for a national
                            discussion. Then, we will present the draft to the Seventh Session of
                            the Party Congress in November.</p>
                        <p>In social policy, we are building during this five-year plan more than
                            100,000 apartments per year. During the next five-year plan, we estimate
                            we shall build 1,500,000 apartments. These figures are not too high at
                            all given our housing needs. The housing problem in Poland is extremely
                            important, if you know what Poland was like after World War II. The
                            first World War also resulted in certain damages and some of those
                            damages; have been preserved to this day. We try to devote much
                            attention to housing. It is linked to the dynamic growth of the country
                            in general and linked to a considerable birth rate. Poland has over
                            34,000,000 population and this trend still continues to be quite high.
                            But houses have to be given to the people.</p>
                        <p>In the economy we now put much stress on the full utilization of raw
                            materials including energy, the modernization of other branches of
                            industry, and the acceleration of growth of food production. We have
                            prepared a special program which we are now implementing. Poland has
                            conditions for even more rapid development. We are one of the ten most
                            highly industrialized countries in the world. We have an energy base,
                            including not only coal (deposits of which are sufficient for 200
                            years), but also big deposits <pb n="6" xml:id="d54-06" facs="d54-06"
                            />of copper, sulphur, salt and other raw materials. Naturally, we have a
                            strong excavating industry and a scientific base. There are good natural
                            conditions for an increase in food production which in a short period of
                            time should make us self-sufficient. Our optimism and accelerated
                            production make this possible. Poland has an exceptionally good
                            structure of population. In 1971-80 about 6,500,000 young people start
                            their work and they represent an active and very well educated cadre. I
                            could mention also the conditions which assure us supplies of iron ore
                            from the Soviet Union as well as conditions which provide opportunities
                            for sale of our products in the Soviet Union. The most important factor
                            on which we base ourselves is the active support of our people for a
                            rapid socio-economic development of the country. The present development
                            strategy should bring Poland a two-fold growth in income per capita. We
                            shall, therefore, bring about a new quality in the living standards of
                            our people. Naturally, Mr. President, the successful implementation of
                            our strategy is based on the process of development of international
                            detente. This favors the development of relations between the East and
                            West and favors the easing of defense burdens which the country has to
                            bear. Let me not say anything more about social development. I shall
                            pass to relations between our respective countries.</p>
                        <p>Poland is a socialist country linked by an unbreakable alliance with the
                            Soviet Union. We are linked by the convergence of the basic interests of
                            the socialist states. All our alliances strengthen the development of
                            national identity and broad relations with our partners. This is true
                            for-reasons of development and it is particularly true with the United
                            States. There are a number of objective factors which favor cooperation
                            between Poland and the United States. They pertain to the role of the
                            United States in the world, in Europe, and relations between our
                            nations. The multi-million group of Americans of Polish descent, we
                            consider, enrich and consolidate our relations. Today this is what
                            detente means for the development of our cooperation. The key element in
                            detente is cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union.
                            As a result of our contacts in the economic, scientific, <pb n="7"
                                xml:id="d54-07" facs="d54-07"/>cultural and political areas and the
                            contacts between our peoples, we can say that our relations have become
                            less sensitive to inadvisable moments in the international session. This
                            allows us to hope for further lasting cooperation between our two
                            countries. We note with great satisfaction that we have made
                            considerable progress both in the content of our relations and in the
                            strengthening of the political climate. These are our feelings. It is
                            your contribution and the contribution of your close collaborators whose
                            support we very highly value. At this juncture let me thank Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DRT1">Davies</persName> for his personal share
                            in the contribution to the development of our relations. He reminds us
                            both of many issues from the position he occupies, and I should say that
                            the process is reciprocal.</p>
                        <p>Before you came, we reviewed the implementation of all the agreements and
                            decisions reached in the United States. We noted that they were being
                            favorably implemented. We are convinced that these decisions and
                            agreements will be implemented in the same way as thus far. It is our
                            intention to expand Polish-American cooperation. We would like to ask
                            you to sponsor this as you have done so far. During my visit to the
                            United States, we concentrated on economic cooperation. I would like to
                            call on the Prime Minister, but before I do so, let me touch upon some
                            other questions. The present developments call for more frequent
                            political contacts on different levels. I believe these contacts have
                            proved useful and there is nothing against having topics developed,
                            discussed and agreed in separate conversations.</p>
                        <p>As far as cultural cooperation and exchanges of information are
                            concerned, we are aware of the position of the United States in <gloss
                                target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss> on cultural exchanges and exchanges
                            of persons, seeing in them a contribution to rapprochement among
                            nations. Our people are eager to learn about the achievements of other
                            peoples including the United States. The achievements of the United
                            States in science and culture are very widely known in Poland. We would
                            like greater reciprocity. We see progress in that field. As for
                            humanitarian relations, they do not have the character of a serious
                            problem. Most cases are individual ones and we generally take care of
                            them in a positive way.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d54-08" facs="d54-08"/>
                        <p>We know that the United States is approaching its 200th anniversary. This
                            was symbolized by the exhibit “The World of Franklin and Jefferson”
                            which you were kind enough to speak about. The Bicentennial in the
                            United States will be noted in a dignified way in Poland. We have been
                            getting ready for a long time in Poland and will show all that which
                            testifies to the greatness of the United States, the greatness of the
                            American people.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Mr. President, we want to assure you that the people of Poland
                            wish the great American people further development and further progress.
                            Allow me to introduce the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, who
                            would like to talk to you of specific economic problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_JP3">Jaroszewicz</persName>: Mr. President, as we
                            look at Polish-American economic relations, let me touch upon five
                            questions. In 1974 trade exceeded $770 million, an increase of 55
                            percent above 1973. In the balance sheet, this is accounted for by the
                            growth of both imports and exports with an increase in Poland's disfavor
                            from $150 to $250 million. This negative balance of trade was also
                            affected by the growth in prices of agricultural products which we
                            import.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First, in 1975 we have fixed a target of $900 million. There are
                                certain difficulties--passing difficulties-- and we are taking a
                                number of courses of action. What is particularly disquieting is the
                                lack of new co-production agreements, as for instance the good
                                cooperation with International Harvester.</item>
                            <item>Second, in agriculture, we note considerable possibilities for
                                further exchanges, for agricultural exchanges. Poland is interested
                                in long-term purchases of grain and fodder on the American market at
                                a level of 1-1-1/2 million tons annually within the framework of
                                    <gloss target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> credits. We are also
                                interested in concluding a long-term agreement for the importation
                                of grain and fodder. After the Soviet Union, the United States is
                                the biggest partner for the improvement of the standard of living of
                                the Polish people. We have had <pb n="9" xml:id="d54-09"
                                    facs="d54-09"/>difficulties because the meteorological
                                conditions have not been too satisfactory. We are able to count on
                                the favorable attitude of the Soviet Union in this important
                                question for us. We can offer long-term deliveries of our sugar to
                                the United States. Deliveries of sugar would stabilize our trade and
                                allow us to expand our sugar industry accordingly.</item>
                            <item>
                                <p>Third, concerning technology, present conversations which give
                                    hope for successful conclusion concern purchases of big
                                    investment projects. These negotiations in many cases are
                                    nearing conclusion. They include installation of coal
                                    gasification technology by Koppers; an agreement on cooperation
                                    with General Motors on a plant to produce delivery trucks of
                                    1-1/2- 2-1/2 ton capacity at the rate of 100,000 per year; the
                                    purchase of technology and know-how from RCA for the production
                                    of TV screens for color TV; equipment for the production of
                                    glass and other parts for TV screens from Corning Glass; the
                                    purchase of forges from Swindell-Dressler; and the expansion of
                                    cooperation in construction machinery with International
                                    Harvester. What is significant is that these contracts would
                                    amount to $1 billion and some are of particular importance, for
                                    example, the purchase of production and technology for TV
                                    screens to produce color TV.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: It would be great
                                    propaganda because of the number of pieces involved.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <persName corresp="#p_JP3">Jaroszewicz</persName>: And the motor
                                    car industry. These transactions also provide for co-production
                                    and for export, including to the. U. S. market. All of this
                                    would depend on the availability of favorable credits to finance
                                    them. This means that we ask for the support of all those
                                    transactions by the U.S. Government and the greatest possible
                                    support from Ex-Im Bank.</p>
                            </item>
                            <item>Fourth, <pb n="10" xml:id="d54-10" facs="d54-10"/>cooperation by
                                means of the facilities of the mixed commission on trade (Joint
                                U.S.-Polish Trade Commission). We would like to request you to agree
                                that at the next meeting we would discuss ways and means to
                                accelerate the dynamic growth of mutual cooperation by implementing
                                the decisions taken during the talks in Washington. We should also
                                take up the question of certain limitations in new agreements. We
                                would be grateful to you, Mr. President, if you could lend these
                                questions favorable consideration and if you could accept the
                                conclusions of the Commission following its meeting next
                                October.</item>
                            <item>Fifth, scientific and technical cooperation. We link our great
                                expectation for progress on coal research which we have discussed
                                many times. We would like to expand our relations in agriculture by
                                exchanges of experience and by means of the conversations which our
                                Minister of Agriculture will have next fall in Washington. We are
                                willing to consider a long-term contract which would open up good
                                prospects. Among other questions, it is important for the
                                development of tourist and personal traffic to have further air
                                connections. These are a few of the things which we believe offer
                                great possibilities for the development of economic relations. As I
                                said, there is great significance to these fields and we would like
                                to have your favorable support. Thank you.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The President: Mr. Secretary, let me thank you and your colleague for
                            this very broad and detailed presentation of our relations. But I should
                            at the outset say that this visit and this occasion brings back three
                            memories. The first is the memory of meeting in Washington last October.
                            The establishment of personal relations gave us the opportunity to
                            discuss in detail the relations between our countries and how to broaden
                            and improve these relations. The second came 16 years ago in Warsaw--my
                            first experience in public life to meet with the Parliamentarians from
                            many, many countries. And we met for ten days in this building with 100
                            Parliamentarians. The third memory is the warmth of that reception by
                            the Polish people today which is a symbol of the close relations we have
                            with Poland. It is not only based on the feelings of millions of
                            Americans of Polish background but also the feelings we have for many,
                            many reasons.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d54-11" facs="d54-11"/>
                        <p>If I might, let me say a few words about relations between Poland and the
                            United States. We feel that in a number of areas considerable progress
                            has been made. In the cultural field, artists who have come from Poland
                            to America make a magnificent impression. They are loved in the United
                            States and we would like to see more of them. And ours who have come
                            here know how warmly they have been received here.</p>
                        <p>In trade, the figures cited indicate a great increase in the purchases by
                            Poland of commodities. We hope trade can increase on a reciprocal basis.
                            The companies cited by your colleague--General Motors, Corning Glass--I
                            know would like to expand trade with Poland. I know the commission
                            working on such matters will work out details and Eximbank will be as
                            helpful as possible. Private banking can also help. My understanding is
                            that David Rockefeller and his bank are interested in expanding trade
                            through the private sector.</p>
                        <p>In the area of agricultural sales, let me say that the United States is
                            very fortunate that, with only 6% of our people involved in agriculture
                            out of a total of 214 million people, they do a tremendous job. They
                            have tremendous productive capacity and make it possible not only to
                            feed our people but provide food to people in Europe, in other countries
                            and throughout the world. As you know, agriculture is not the most
                            consistent industry and we cannot be sure of a certain harvest. Last
                            year, the harvest in grains and corn was not at the level anticipated.
                            It was big but not as big as expected. This year, we anticipate a
                            favorable wheat harvest, the largest in our history. If the weather is
                            good during the next month, we will have the largest corn crop in the
                            history of the United States. We have noticed that other areas of the
                            world have far less favorable conditions for agricultural production.
                            The United States to the maximum degree possible will seek to help
                            countries in need. We have had good relations with Poland in the past in
                            feedgrains. This year, too, I would hope to have good relations in
                            feedgrains.</p>
                        <p>We are interested in your suggestion that your sugar production
                            capability might help us. Last year, we had a shortage and prices were
                            very high throughout the world. The situation has been mitigated to some
                                <pb n="12" xml:id="d54-12" facs="d54-12"/>extent but we are
                            interested. If your Minister of Agriculture is coming to the United
                            States in the near future, he might discuss this with Mr. Butz, the
                            Secretary of Agriculture.</p>
                        <p>I was very interested in your comments on energy and coal. The United
                            States and Poland have ample supplies of coal. You said you have
                            anticipated supplies for 365 years. The United States has anticipated
                            supplies for 300 years. Both of us have a mutual interest in the
                            production of coal. You have mining techniques, first-hand, and we have
                            technology and equipment which can be used on a reciprocal basis.</p>
                        <p>In the field of science and technology in certain areas, we have made
                            great progress. In space we have done extremely well. The many
                            byproducts of space technology can be made available to peoples
                            throughout the world. In medicine, we feel benefits can be made
                            available. These benefits can be exchanged with the advances made in
                            your country.</p>
                        <p>There are, of course, a number of cases of people with relatives who want
                            to be reunited with their families. I was very interested in your
                            statement that most cases can and will be resolved. That would be
                            beneficial to our relations.</p>
                        <p>I met with Congressman Rostenkowski, my representative at the Poznan
                            Fair. He met with you. He gave me a full report. He was very
                            complimentary about how he had been treated and explained how you wanted
                            to establish close relations with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Let me turn now to detente and the many ramifications which come from it.
                            I have long been, am now, and continue to expect to be an advocate of
                            detente. I am aware that detente cannot solve all problems, but that
                            concept is and has been very useful in relieving tensions. Detente in
                            the future will be a useful tool for the betterment of relations between
                            the Soviet Union and the United States as well as the associates of the
                            Soviet Union and the allies of the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="d54-13" facs="d54-13"/>
                        <p>There are people in the United States who raise questions about the
                            advisability of detente. Some raise questions on the basis that the
                            United States got less than the Soviet Union. Others have a strong
                            dislike of the political system in the Soviet Union and believe that
                            somehow detente perpetuates that system. My feeling is that we have our
                            system and the Soviets have their system. Detente is not aimed at
                            changing the system--but at problems which can be resolved. On the other
                            hand, it has to be understood, particularly in our system, that in order
                            to maintain detente and in order to defuse political criticism in the
                            United States certain statements both oral as well as written have to be
                            made to soften the criticisms of some of our people. Otherwise, some
                            people in authority face internal political problems. There must be a
                            sophisticated understanding of our political system. Those in the Soviet
                            Union must understand that our system works differently, that a person
                            must be judged by his actions, not his words. As I meet with <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> in Helsinki and, hopefully, in
                            the United States, I can assure you, as I will him, that detente has
                            been of great benefit to the United States, the Soviet Union, and the
                            world as a whole. And we must continue detente for the benefits which we
                            have had in the past and which we hope to achieve in the future. It
                            requires understanding and sophistication. We very sincerely want to
                            build better cooperation and a bridge for better relations between us
                            and the world. You, I and Dr. <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> are going to Helsinki. There has been some
                            criticism in the United States that I should not go--criticism from the
                            extreme right and some liberals and left-inclined. I believe Helsinki is
                            a step in the right direction. Much will depend on execution and
                            implementation. It is our obligation to see to it that it is implemented
                            in the right fashion. If it achieves what I think, criticism in the
                            United States will be eliminated and I am optimistic enough to believe
                            that it will be accomplished.</p>
                        <p>With the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, we have made significant
                            progress in SALT I. While in Helsinki, we expect to discuss the
                            outgrowth of very successful talks in Vladivostok. If the talks bring us
                            closer, then it will be another giant step forward in limiting strategic
                            arms and lifting the arms burden and increasing opportunities for peace
                            throughout the world.</p>

                        <p>In closing, I feel our discussion this afternoon and earlier today
                            broadened the foundations for much better relations between both our
                            peoples. I pledge to you, we will make a maximum effort so that Poland
                            and the United States have an opportunity to feel closer in the years
                            ahead.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>: Thank you heartily, Mr.
                            President, for what you said. (Looks up and down the table.)</p>
                        <p>I don't know if anyone wants to say anything. Mr. President, let me refer
                            to one subject. This is our attitude to matters of detente and all that
                            is linked to Helsinki. I want to speak here not as a Pole alone because
                            if I were to approach this as a Pole from a narrow point of view, I
                            would have to emphasize the need for understanding. I would like to
                            speak as one whose country ranks second in our socialist group after the
                            Soviet Union, both in economic and in military terms. We are grown up.
                            We are a country which is a member of the Warsaw Treaty with all the
                            consequences which ensue from that fact. As the second largest in the
                            Warsaw Treaty, we, like the Soviets, are not interested in Helsinki only
                            for the merely spectacular phenomenon but in all that will follow from
                            it. We realize there are some forces in the world against detente. You
                            speak of a very narrow group in the United States. We would note there
                            are broader groups. We should make no less effort after Helsinki than
                            the effort that we have made up to now. I say this for Poland, the
                            second socialist country. I am not aware of what <persName
                                corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> is going to talk to you
                            about--I am not curious but one day I will learn. But I am convinced
                            that Leonid <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> will say
                            what he feels, and he feels the need for consistent consolidation of the
                            process of detente. This is not only his feeling but the feeling of
                            Soviet leaders, of the Soviet people. I base all this on something--the
                            willingness and readiness to strengthen detente is because of the means
                            of destruction which are sufficient to destroy everything many, many
                            times. The problem is to seek ways and means to freeze the situation and
                            bring about such a degree of mutual trust that we could rest assured
                            that the world would not be changed into a place of danger. Naturally,
                            the world has all kinds of dangerous situations. But all these are not
                            as <pb n="15" xml:id="d54-15" facs="d54-15"/>dangerous as if you and the
                            Russians enter the path to war. We shall use all our possibilities--and
                            we have quite a lot of them--not only to smoke a peace pipe but also to
                            see that all the consequences of the peace pipe are implemented. We are
                            going to Helsinki to sign the documents and to implement them.</p>
                        <p>The President: This has been a very fruitful and beneficial discussion.
                            Thank you and your colleagues for the opportunity to be with you this
                            afternoon. We shall see you this evening.</p>

                            SOME COMMENTS TO ME ON THE CURRENT CON-<lb/>CERNS OF THE POLISH REGIME.
                            HE WAS ACTIVELY SECONDED BY VICE<lb/>MARSHAL OF THE SEJM ANDRZEJ WERBLAN
                            (PZPR) AND, SOMEWHAT LESS<lb/>ACTIVELY, BY MARSHAL STANISLAW GUCWA

                        <p>2. <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName> SAID THAT THERE SEEMED TO

                            REPRESENTED<lb/>A NECESSARY STEP. IT WAS HIS IMPRESSION THAT MOST MEDIA
                            COM-<lb/>MENTATORS TOOK A SYMPATHETIC ATTITUDE TOWARDS THOSE
                            MEASURES,<lb/>“EXCEPT FOR THE TOMFOOLERY OF RADIO FREE EUROPE, WHICH
                            WIL-<lb/>FULLY DISTORTS THE SITUATION.” HE WENT ON, “THEIS

                            YEARS. IT WAS<lb/>NOW ESSENTIAL THAT IT SHOULD RISE IN POLAND. I SAID
                            I<lb/>COULD NOT DISPUTE WITH HIM ABOUT THE DOMESTIC-ECONOMIC<lb/>PROGRAM

                        <p>5. <persName corresp="#p_GE1">GIEREK</persName> SAID THAT POLAND HAD

                            TO MAKE HER VOICE<lb/>COUNT IN EUROPE. “RFE STUPIDLY PLAYS INTO THE

                        <p>6. I SAID AGAIN THAT I COULD ASSURE HIM THAT NO ONE IN MY<lb/>GOVERNMENT
                            WANTED TO WEAKEN POLAND.</p>

                        <p>The Polish people's forceful rejection of price increases in June
                            continues to dominate the political atmosphere in Warsaw. Party and
                            government leaders are still suffering from the trauma of the riots and
                            are postponing decisions on critical economic problems.</p>
                        <p>In increasingly frank terms they have warned the sullen and distrustful

                            still in short supply, and popular dissatisfaction has by no means
                            decreased. Tensions will remain high and could explode again into public

                        <p>Contentiousness of the kind that sparked the rioting is deeply ingrained
                            in the Polish character. Particularly since the partitions of the
                            country 200 years ago, Poles have regarded civil disobedience and
                            opposition to foreign occupiers as patriotic virtues essential to the
                            re-emergence of the Polish state. The period between the World Wars was
                            too brief to alter these beliefs, and opposition to authority again
                            became standard after the communists took power.</p>
                        <p>Although communist rule is accepted as a fact of life, the party has
                            never enjoyed general acceptance. Most Poles believe that the party
                            rules ultimately because of the proximity of the Soviet Union. This is
                            particularly galling because they see themselves essentially as a people
                            tied by history and by social and cultural values to Western Europe. The
                            Soviet Union, as the successor to Tsarist Russia, is widely regarded as
                            a backward, boorish monolith, but one that has a lot of clout. Under
                            these circumstances, the party under <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> has concentrated on providing the Poles with a
                            higher standard of living as the primary way of winning popular
                            acceptance.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> came to power in December
                            1970 in the wake of bloody rioting over food price hikes and eventually
                            restored the old prices. Basic food prices have not risen since, despite
                            burgeoning subsidies which between 1970 and 1975 rose from less than 6
                            percent to 14 percent of budget outlays.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the new leadership set the goal of rapid modernization and
                            expansion of the Polish economy. <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> realized that he could do this only through
                            massive imports of Western technology. Gomulka had shied away from this
                            course, primarily because of his fear of going heavily into debt to the
                            West. <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>, who had spent twenty
                            years of his early life in France and Belgium, did not share his
                            fears.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>'s earlier career in
                            the party foreshadowed such a course. While party boss in Poland's key
                            industrial province of Katowice, he surrounded himself with young,
                            relatively nationalistic party functionaries and educated and
                            discontented technocrats who were seeking remedies for Poland's mounting
                            economic and social problems. This younger generation wanted a more
                            dynamic alternative to the slow pace of modernization of the Gomulka
                            era. They were convinced that such policies would only add fuel to
                            growing popular dissatisfaction.</p>
                        <p>With <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>'s accession, these
                            younger technocrats were placed in responsible positions in those
                            sectors of the Polish bureaucracy responsible <pb n="4" xml:id="d57-04"
                                facs="d57-04"/>for contacts with the West. Thus, an institutional
                            bias toward increased trade with the West has been built up in Polish
                            administrative structures.</p>
                        <p>As a consequence of <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>'s
                            policies, investment boomed, and Poland achieved a high economic growth
                            gate. Additionally, frequent wage increases and controlled prices
                            enabled the average Pole's real personal income to grow by 9 percent a
                            year.</p>
                        <p>The import of Western capital goods has been used to expand and modernize
                            basic industries, and much of the output has been earmarked for export
                            to pay off foreign credits. In addition, many of the projects have been
                            slow to come on stream. For these reasons, Western imports have often
                            provided only indirect or delayed benefits to the consumer.</p>
                        <p>Consumption has increased sharply, but a large share of the growth went
                            into food because Warsaw was unable to provide enough attractive
                            consumer durables. Consumption of meat, supported by the growth of the
                            domestic fodder base, increased about 32 percent between 1970 and
                            1975.</p>
                        <p>The population has thus become accustomed to food consumption increases
                            at rates that are no longer sustainable. The problem has been compounded
                            since 1974 by bad weather, which resulted in a decline in grain and
                            fodder output—not fully made up by imports—to support meat production.
                            The increasing pressures on supply have led to the preset situation.</p>
                        <p>The imbalance had to be corrected by raising food prices, and the Poles
                            would probably have accepted small price rises over the past few years
                            with minimal grumbling. But party leaders, fearful that price increases,
                            especially on meat, would create political instability, postponed any
                            decision until last June. Then they compounded their earlier mistake by
                            announcing unacceptably sharp increases.</p>
                        <p>This decision clearly caught the public off guard and was almost
                            certainly taken without close consultation either with grass-roots party
                            members or with the population. The ensuing riots forced Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_JP3">Jaroszewicz</persName> into a hasty
                            withdrawal of the proposals one day later.</p>
                        <p>Tensions have since remained high. The Polish people, anticipating price
                            hikes, have been hoarding many consumer items and thus creating
                            additional shortages. The situation is so serious that the regime was
                            forced to introduce sugar rationing.</p>
                        <p>In an effort to cool the popular temper, the regime has decided to delay
                            price increases on food for at least a year or possibly until mid-1978
                            and has <pb n="5" xml:id="d57-05" facs="d57-05"/>promised to “consult”
                            extensively with workers before any changes are made.</p>
                        <p>Problems in the Party</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>'s status within the
                            leadership is clearly weaker than it was before June, and a certain
                            amount of jockeying for position is under way. Some efforts to find a
                            scapegoat are reportedly being made in the Politburo, and there is no
                            agreement on how best to proceed on sensitive economic problems.</p>
                        <p>Decision-making in the Politburo under <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> has been based on consensus and not on diktat.
                            During less troubled times, hammering out a consensus presented no
                            serious problems. Over the past few years, however, policy differences
                            have apparently been generating some friction. Although we lack specific
                            evidence on the nature and depth of the disputes, the pace of economic
                            development must have been a central issue. There have been hints that
                            some members of the Politburo felt that the regime was pushing
                            modernization too fast and that this was creating both a restive
                            population and too much dependence on the West. The majority of the
                            leaders, including <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>, have
                            pushed for continued rapid development.</p>
                        <p>The relationship between <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> and
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_JP3">Jaroszewicz</persName> is
                            clearly strained. One source asserts that <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> was under constant pressure from government
                            experts, especially <persName corresp="#p_JP3">Jaroszewicz</persName>,
                            to approve the June price package. The resulting riots reportedly
                            triggered a “profound psychological trauma” in <persName
                                corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>, and he probably blames the
                            government for bad advice.</p>
                        <p>Since June, <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_JP3">Jaroszewicz</persName> have not appeared together
                            as frequently as in the past. In addition, <persName corresp="#p_JP3"
                                >Jaroszewicz</persName> was out of sight from September 23 until
                            October 11. The embassy has heard rumors that he was sick, but his
                            absence may also have been related to wrangling over policy issues. On
                            October 11, <persName corresp="#p_JP3">Jaroszewicz</persName> reappeared
                            with <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> at a ceremony in
                            Czestochowa. Since then he has resumed a full and active schedule,
                            including a one-day visit to Moscow. In discussing that visit, the
                            Politburo said that the agreements adopted would be of “fundamental
                            importance” for the successful implementation of Poland's current social
                            and economic tasks. This is a relatively strong endorsement of <persName
                                corresp="#p_JP3">Jaroszewicz</persName>'s efforts and also a
                            recognition of the standing that the premier enjoys in Moscow.</p>
                        <p>Since the June crisis, party politicians have reportedly decided that
                            they need to reassert their supremacy over the economic experts in the
                            government. <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>'s unusual
                            presence at a session of the Council of Ministers in September may have
                            been a move in this direction. The party also <pb n="6" xml:id="d57-06"
                                facs="d57-06"/>created five special party-government teams to tackle
                            the most sensitive economic problems. They will apparently bypass, to
                            some extent, the existing government bureaucracy.</p>
                        <p>We do not believe that <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> is
                            about to resign or be removed: <list>
                                <item>—His resignation would publicly underscore the party's
                                    internal weakness, something neither the party nor Moscow

                                    power in the wake of public revulsion against the bloody
                                    suppression of striking workers in Gdansk. During the
                                    demonstrations and riots in June, the police were held in
                                    check.</item>

                                    gave in on the issue, his position was proven correct.</item>
                                <item>—No one is standing in the wings ready to take over. <persName

                                    the leadership realizes that a change at the top will not by
                                    itself satisfy the public, which is concerned about solutions to
                                    serious economic problems. Any replacement would, come from the
                                    current Politburo, and no one in that body could inspire more
                                    public confidence than <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                        >Gierek</persName> himself.</item>

                        <p>There has been little reporting on the relationships among the members of
                            the Politburo. Edward Babiuch, Jan Szydlak, and Stanislaw Kania appear
                            to be the most influential after <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName>. Only these four are party secretaries as well as
                            full Politburo members.</p>
                        <p>Babiuch (48) is responsible for intra-party affairs and for contacts with
                            foreign communist parties. He has been an organizational apparatchik his
                            entire career and has not involved himself deeply in economic matters.
                            We believe that he works closely with <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Szydlak (51) is responsible for ideology and general economic matters. He
                            is known as a tough party type and a good administrator. His chances for
                            becoming first secretary would be hurt by rumors circulating in Poland
                            that he served in the German Army during World War II.</p>
                        <p>Kania (49) is responsible for party oversight of the military and the
                            internal security apparatus. He is a relatively unknown figure.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ambassador was recently told that
                            middle-level Polish officials described Babiuch, Szydlak, and <persName

                            The ambassador had never heard Babiuch referred to in this way. We
                            cannot confirm this but, if true, it suggests significant maneuvering
                            within the leadership.</p>

                            Roman Catholic church. For most of their history, Poles have equated
                            being Catholic with being Polish, and today about 90 percent of the
                            population is Catholic—with 80 percent practicing.
                                <persName>Stefan</persName> Cardinal Wyszynski, the crusty Primate,
                            embodies the concept of the church as a prime repository of Polish
                            patriotism. Throughout <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>'s
                            tenure, a delicate truce has existed between church and state. Although
                            the current leaders have not given up their opposition to the church—and
                            indeed cannot—they feel they can afford a long-term battle and want to
                            concentrate popular attention and efforts on economic development.</p>
                        <p>The Cardinal strongly asserts the church's status but has not challenged
                            the regime during difficult economic times. Party leaders generally
                            regard him as a patriot and took the unusual step of asking the Vatican
                            not to accept Wyszynski's resignation when he reached age 75 last
                            August. Over recent weeks, he has more aggressively criticized current
                            regime policies.</p>
                        <p>The Intellectuals</p>
                        <p>The re-emergence of active intellectual dissent will also limit the
                            leadership's ability to act. Beginning in late 1974, some of the
                            long-established dissidents who had been quiescent since 1968 began
                            circulating petitions and sending critical letters to the authorities in
                            Warsaw. These efforts were redoubled in late 1975 when the regime
                            proposed constitutional amendments that would have symbolically tied
                            Poland even closer to the Soviet Union and incontrovertibly anchored the
                            party's role in the constitution. The amendments were subsequently
                            watered down significantly.</p>
                        <p>The June fiasco over price increases was another stimulus to dissident
                            activity and has created at least a temporary bond between
                            intellectuals—including some students—and the working class. Only rarely
                            in postwar Polish history have the workers and intellectuals been active
                            at the same time in criticizing regime policies.</p>
                        <p>The creation in September of the Workers' Defense League is the best
                            illustration of the strength of the dissidents and of Warsaw's cautious
                            approach toward them. The League was created by 14 intellectuals who
                            openly signed a petition criticizing the regime for its persecution of
                            workers <pb n="8" xml:id="d57-08" facs="d57-08"/>who participated in the
                            June strikes. The League has circulated several appeals and has openly
                            solicited funds to aid workers' families.</p>
                        <p>According to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> embassy, this
                            organization was founded at Warsaw University, where the leadership is
                            reportedly worried about the possibility of an outbreak of violence. Out
                            of fear of stimulating violence, the security organs have kept a low
                            profile at the university and have taken no repressive measures against
                            student dissidents.</p>
                        <p>Although intellectuals are also concerned about economic problems and use
                            day-to-day problems as a vehicle for voicing criticism, they are
                            primarily concerned about the broader aspects of Poland's domestic
                            system and its foreign relations. Their demands are thus much less
                            easily met, and the regime will try to ignore them. The first priority
                            will be to find solutions to the economic problems which have raised the
                            ire of the consumers.</p>
                        <p>Economic Prospects</p>
                        <p>The need for dramatic corrective measures in the economy comes at a time
                            when Poland's options are limited. Because of severe problems in its
                            hard-currency balance of payments, Poland has little flexibility in
                            foreign trade.</p>
                        <p>Warsaw's decision to freeze food prices for at least another year will
                            aggravate the supply problem. On the other hand, wages cannot be frozen
                            without causing adverse worker reaction. Neither can the regime force
                            the farmer to increase agricultural deliveries without irritating yet
                            another segment of the population.</p>
                        <p>The pressure on meat supplies is not likely to ease soon. Livestock
                            inventories are down because farmers—faced with fodder shortages for
                            several months—could not maintain them, resulting in some distress
                            slaughtering, Herds cannot be rebuilt quickly. It will be impossible at
                            current prices to satisfy the demand for meat and meat products for at
                            least a year.</p>
                        <p>Warsaw could introduce meat rationing as a short-term measure to achieve
                            equitable distribution and reduce queues. Rationing, however, would not
                            increase available supplies. In any case, a recent press article
                            indicates that the government may have decided against this course.</p>
                        <p>Poland's only option is to increase supply by importing large amounts of
                            grain and fodder. Imports are projected at 7 million tons—about the same
                            as last year—in the marketing year ending June 30, 1977. Most will come
                            from the West, requiring over $1 billion in hard-currency expenditures.
                            The <pb n="9" xml:id="d57-09" facs="d57-09"/>Poles hope to obtain some 4
                            million tons from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> alone. Warsaw is
                            also stepping up meat imports—mostly from the West—and making further
                            cuts in meat exports, an important source of hard currency.</p>
                        <p>Poland's heavy hard-currency debt burden and the need for large imports
                            of grain and fodder for at least another year will force Warsaw to cut
                            back even more severely on imports of industrial materials. Another
                            large deficit on the order of the $3 billion incurred last year is
                            expected in 1976, and the debt is expected to rise to $10 billion, up
                            from $6.9 billion at the end of 1975.</p>
                        <p>Difficulties in obtaining the financing needed to cover continued large
                            deficits and to meet debt obligations are likely, and Poland may well be
                            forced to allow little if any import growth over the next few years.
                            Without a vast improvement in agricultural production, the Poles will
                            have to continue to hold down imports of industrial materials. Thus,
                            Warsaw may be forced to reduce its economic growth plans. Before doing
                            so, however, it is likely to seek help from the West in refinancing or
                            rescheduling part of its debt.</p>
                        <p>Soviet Response</p>
                        <p>Moscow is obviously worried about the situation and is primarily
                            interested in seeing that political stability is maintained. On the
                            other hand, the Soviet leaders are not willing to dip too deeply into
                            their own resources to bail out Poland if they can avoid it. They see
                            Poland's problems as stemming largely from Warsaw's questionable
                            policies.</p>
                        <p>Under Gomulka, Polish-Soviet relations developed to the point that the
                            Poles exercised a high level of autonomy in internal matters in exchange
                            for consistent loyalty to Soviet foreign policy objectives. Moscow
                            fairly quickly threw its support behind <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> in the troubled times of early 1971, and even
                            provided him with a $100-million hard-currency loan to purchase meat.
                            Although the Soviets were reportedly skeptical about some of <persName
                                corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>'s early personnel moves, he was
                            able to bring a new and younger team to the top, but one that was less
                            familiar to the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Soviet leaders have, however, become increasingly concerned about
                            Poland's growing indebtedness to the West and its policy of rapid wage
                            increases. In August 1975, Soviet Premier <persName corresp="#p_KAN1"
                                >Kosygin</persName> visited Warsaw and reportedly berated the Polish
                            leadership for its policies. <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> must have won at least grudging approval for his
                            course, since he soon thereafter appointed a man to head the planning
                            commission whom the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> embassy considers
                            Poland's leading proponent of increased trade with the West.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d57-10" facs="d57-10"/>
                        <p>Actually neither the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> nor the other
                            East European countries can provide all the modern machinery and
                            financial aid which Poland needs, thus in effect forcing Warsaw to turn
                            to the West. The Poles have undoubtedly used this argument in countering
                            Moscow's complaints.</p>
                        <p>Several reports indicate Soviet unhappiness over the way Warsaw has
                            handled the price increase problem. One official recently called the
                            decisions “stupid,” which is probably a general assessment.</p>
                        <p>The current Soviet attitude toward supporting Poland should become
                            clearer after <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName>'s visit to
                            Moscow, which began November 9. He led a party and state delegation that
                            included Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_JP3"
                                >Jaroszewicz</persName>. This is the first such visit to Moscow by
                            the Polish leadership since Gomulka was in power.</p>
                        <p>We expect that the Soviet leaders, despite the misgivings they might
                            have, will display their full support for the current Polish leadership.
                            To do otherwise would be to risk further political instability within
                            Poland. Polish leaders will have to come away from Moscow with some
                            tangible economic help as confirmation of that support. There will
                            probably be an announcement on the resumption of grain deliveries. One
                            recent report claimed that this visit had been scheduled earlier but
                            that the Soviets had delayed making a commitment on deliveries. This
                            difficulty has apparently been ironed out.</p>
                        <p>A Delaying Game</p>
                        <p>Grappling with these thorny and frustrating economic problems and with
                            the after-effects of the June riots will put the leadership to a very
                            severe test. <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> and his
                            cohorts know that without demonstrable improvement in the economy, they
                            cannot regain the public confidence they have lost. They also realize
                            that it may take several years to solve the problems of shortages.
                            Painfully aware that the party has been forced to bow to the popular
                            will twice in six years and that the people are increasingly conscious
                            of their own power, the leaders will take no action that would send
                            their unruly subjects into the streets again.</p>
                        <p>In this atmosphere, the leadership has decided to retreat from many of
                            its previously announced positions.</p>
                        <p>—Price increases on basic food items will be postponed, probably until
                            mid-1978.</p>
                        <p>—The Polish Supreme Court has released seven workers sentenced to jail
                            terms of 3 to 10 years for participating in the Ursus tractor factory
                                <pb n="11" xml:id="d57-11" facs="d57-11"/>disturbances. The
                            leadership realized that pursuing their case against the rioters could
                            only deepen public disaffection.</p>
                        <p>—The regime has withdrawn from the Sejm a proposed law on agriculture
                            that would have allowed the confiscation of inefficiently cultivated
                            land. This law had raised the ire of the Catholic Church and the specter
                            of forced collectivization.</p>
                        <p>In a positive direction the regime announced in mid-October that a broad
                            range of consumer goods will be imported during the fourth quarter of
                            this year. Warsaw obviously hopes that this will help placate restive
                            Polish consumers who are watching to see how many of these goods
                            actually reach the market.</p>
                        <p>At the top of the list is a $38-million purchase of 32,000 metric tons of
                            meat and 10,000 tons of lard. Even with additional imports and sharply
                            curtailed exports, meat supplies will not improve significantly. In fact
                            there will be less meat available in the stores during the next two
                            months than was available in the comparable period last year. The regime
                            hopes that imports of luxury goods will siphon off some of the excess
                            demand for meat. The quantities are probably not sufficient, however, to
                            have the desired impact.</p>
                        <p>The government and party are also openly discussing the need for greater
                            popular involvement in the decision-making process. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> has prided himself on maintaining
                            close contacts with workers, and he often travels around the country
                            visiting factories and farms. At the party congress last December, he
                            promised that the regime would conduct close “consultations” with the
                            public before introducing price increases.</p>
                        <p>This was not done, however, and it is still too soon to determine how—if
                            at all—the regime intends to pursue public participation. Whatever it
                            does, the party must follow a fine line. It must promote the appearance
                            of popular input to decision-making without weakening the “leading role
                            of the party.”</p>
                        <p>The immediate result of the search for better relations with the public
                            is more frankness in discussing Poland's economic problems and
                            prospects. This was most noticeable in <persName corresp="#p_JP3"
                                >Jaroszewicz</persName>'s speech on September 22. The leadership is
                            telling the population that current difficulties are serious but
                            transitory. The leaders are counting on better harvests in the future,
                            which would improve the domestic supply situation and lessen the outflow
                            of hard currency for grain and fodder. They also are banking on an
                            increase of exports from major new industrial complexes to ease the
                            balance-of-payments problems.</p>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="d57-12" facs="d57-12"/>
                        <p>What the regime cannot assess is whether the population is willing to
                            wait.</p>
                        <p>The most dangerous times for the regime, in the near term, will come in
                            the weeks before Christmas and Easter. During these periods the Polish
                            people go on a shopping binge. Normally the government stockpiles
                            sufficient quantities of meat for these occasions, and we presume that
                            this is the case this year also. There could, however, be other
                            irritants this winter that would add to popular discontent. The regime
                            is already cautioning the public to use coal and electricity sparingly.
                            Domestic consumption is expected to reach record levels, and Polish
                            administrators are not certain they have adequate supplies. A severe
                            winter, in contrast to recent relatively warm ones, would severely
                            strain current supplies.</p>
                        <p>If it hopes to retain any rapport with the population, the regime will
                            have to be judicious in applying police power and must avoid the use of
                            excessive force in future outbreaks. <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> is well aware that it was the overreaction by the
                            militarized security forces in 1970 that helped bring down Gomulka. On
                            the practical side, the leaders probably have some concerns about how
                            the police and/or army would react if called upon to put down serious
                            disturbances.</p>
                        <p>According to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> ambassador, there
                            would have been a nationwide general strike on June 26 if the regime had
                            not withdrawn the price proposals the day before. One reason for the
                            hasty retreat may have been concern about the reliability of the police
                            forces. The army may have gone on record as refusing to participate in
                            massive repressions. The ambassador had been told that Defense Minister
                            Jaruzelski simply said “don't ask us” when the subject of possible use
                            of troops was raised.</p>
                        <p>There have been no indications of massive reprisals since the riots.
                            Several individuals lost their jobs, and some were imprisoned. There
                            have undoubtedly been some reprisals initiated by local authorities.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> realizes, however, that
                            to get through these difficult times, he must somehow get the workers to
                            produce more, and he is astute enough to avoid anything that smacks of
                            terror.</p>
                        <p>From an organizational point of view, there seems little more that
                                <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> can do to stimulate the
                            population to harder work. The party, trade unions, and social groups in
                            general have long been used to control the population, but the average
                            Pole ignores these organizations. For this reason, <persName
                                corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> has little recourse other than to
                            invoke Polish patriotism as a motivating force.</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="d57-13" facs="d57-13"/>
                        <p>That <persName corresp="#p_GE1">Gierek</persName> intends to do just this
                            was foreshadowed in his attack on “opponents” who close their eyes to
                            Poland's achievements and parade as “spokesmen of democracy, protectors
                            of national sovereignty, and even of the economic and social rights of
                            the working people.”</p>
                        <p>This kind of appeal to patriotism has worked in the past, but there are
                            no guarantees that it will work this time. However much they are willing
                            to sacrifice for the fatherland, the people are clearly in no mood to
                            accept everything the regime says. They could decide to play their own
                            waiting game and put the onus on <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> to prove that his policies are better than those
                            of his unnamed “opponents"—or those of the scapegoats he may select.</p>
                        <p>If he is to survive in office, <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> will have to demonstrate considerably more
                            political acumen and organizational skill than he has during the past
                            three months. In relatively short order, he must regain the public's
                            confidence—which is still on the wane—heal the wounds in the top
                            leadership, reassure Moscow that political stability will be maintained,
                            and produce some tangible signs of improvement in the domestic economy.
                            The complexity of the tasks that face him, the uncertainty that is so
                            clearly evident in Warsaw, and the volatility of the public make it
                            virtually impossible to predict the outcome.</p>
                        <p>Each time the regime has made a substantial concession to the people, it
                            has reduced its room for maneuver and its political credibility. This
                            pattern of weakness suggests that sooner or later the leadership will
                            decide that it can no longer make concessions and stay in power. It has
                            yet to show that it has the political acumen needed to arrive at the
                            necessary blend of decisive action, firmness, and conciliation. Should
                            the regime miscalculate, the stage could be set for a repetition of the
                            events of December 1970, when <persName corresp="#p_GE1"
                                >Gierek</persName> replaced Gomulka. Moreover, unless substantial
                            Soviet economic aid is promptly delivered, Warsaw will find it difficult
                            to gain the breathing space it needs to cope with dissatisfied workers,
                            intellectuals, and youth.</p>

                        <p>Refer to: I-21397/73</p>
                        <p>Background</p>
                        <p>(S) <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>, the symbol of national
                            unity in Yugoslavia, will be 81 in May. His departure from the scene may
                            precipitate a succession crisis in which the Yugoslav Army is certain to
                            play a major role. Although perhaps the only national force with the
                            cohesion to hold the country together, it is largely an unknown quantity
                            to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> sources because, until recently,
                            our direct contacts with the Yugoslav military have been minimal.</p>
                        <p>Rationale of U.S. Policy</p>
                        <p>(S) <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy interests in the Eastern
                            Mediterranean require that Yugoslav territory be free of Soviet bases.
                            As long as Yugoslavia is able to maintain its political independence of
                            Moscow and its own economic prosperity, it has an excellent chance of
                            maintaining an independent, “unaligned” national policy. If the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and West can offer Yugoslavia alternate
                            sources of military supplies, the traditional Yugoslav independent
                            outlook is enhanced, further promoting <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>(S) Those Yugoslav officials and military functionaries inclined to look
                            to the West for support against Moscow will not expose themselves to
                            risks on faith alone. None are anti-Communists; they are, however,
                            nationalists prepared to fight for Yugoslav independence. They need some
                            concrete evidence that arms and ammunition would be forthcoming in the
                            hour of crisis against Moscow and that friends exist in influential
                            places in the West who understand the special Yugoslav position with
                            respect to the Communist world. It is especially vital now, on the eve
                            of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s death, to instill
                            confidence and to establish special relationships and channels which
                            could be exploited should it later serve the United States national
                            interest to help forces in Yugoslavia resist Soviet aggression.
                            Hopefully, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> will remain
                            alive long enough to permit full development of these relationships;
                            after <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s death it may be too
                            late. If executed negligently, our posture may lack a convincing
                            quality. Alternatively, if inexpert, it may precipitate reactions from
                                Moscow-<pb n="2" xml:id="d58-02" facs="d58-02"/>assigned forces that
                            may prove counter-productive. The balance must be just right, and,
                            properly executed, would exemplify politico-military diplomacy at its
                            best.</p>
                        <p>(S) Moscow, on the other hand, has used the “carrot and stick” approach
                            in its dealings with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s
                            Yugoslavia. Threats of subversion have been offset by offers of aid and
                            the award to <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> of the '“Order
                            of Lenin” on his 80th birthday. Although the Yugoslav population may be
                            generally pro-West and hostile to Moscow, many in the Party and Army
                            bureaucracies owe their success to the Moscow equation. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> himself is one of these and may

                            initiated a program of closer contacts with the Yugoslav military. The
                            guiding principle established at that time and in effect today is that
                            the Yugoslavs themselves would choose a tempo in military contacts they
                            found comfortable. Over the last three years the level of contacts has
                            matured gradually and naturally. The first Yugoslav military delegation
                            visited the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in September 1971;
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> visited in November
                            1971; Colonel-General Dolnicar, Assistant State Secretary for National
                            Defense, was the guest of <gloss target="#t_ASD1">ASD</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName> in May 1972; and a <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Army Team visited Yugoslavia in November
                            1972. Out of these exchanges and against the backdrop of Presidential
                            visits, a greater candor and frankness evolved and some longer term
                            confidence measures developed. The Yugoslavs showed an interest in
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> military equipment with eventual
                            Foreign Military Sales (EMS) potential, while the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> agreed to purchase $4-5 million annually in Yugoslavia
                            for support of our forces in Europe. A <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            Army officer is now a Foreign Area Specialist student in Belgrade, the
                            first ever in a Communist country; two Yugoslav officers are students at
                            the Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth; two
                            Yugoslav officers will enter the Air Command and General Staff College
                            at Maxwell <gloss target="#t_AFB1">AFB</gloss> this summer; and
                            increasingly, the tempo of useful politico-military-diplomatic contacts
                            at all levels is picking up both in Belgrade and in Washington.</p>
                        <p>(U) These improvements have come about at little cost and common <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Yugoslav military goals have been
                            promoted.</p>
                        <p>(S) Two steps initiated just before <gloss target="#t_ASD1">ASD</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_NGW1">Nutter</persName>'s departure were:</p>
                        <p>- To investigate a Security of Information Agreement with the Yugoslavs.
                            Such an agreement would facilitate handling of Yugoslav requests for
                            release of classified information and thereby give the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> bureaucracy a tool to respond quickly and
                            decisively with a definite “yes” or “no”. In a recent cable, (0884 of 2
                            March), <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Embassy Belgrade noted a
                            number of factors tending to inhibit conclusion of an agreement; these
                            are now being weighed in Washington against anticipated positive
                            gains.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d58-03" facs="d58-03"/>
                        <p>- The release of technical data on <gloss target="#t_SIGINT1"
                                >SIGINT</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_COMINT1">COMINT</gloss> equipment
                            leading to possible future <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>. The
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Intelligence Board is now studying
                            this issue and should render its decision in April.</p>
                        <p>(S) The release of classified technical data and subsequent supply
                            actions may well prove vital to the creation of continued reciprocal
                            confidence. During the past three years we have done much to break the
                            ice with the Yugoslav military by supplying minor items, offering
                            training facilities, articulating <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            interest and views, promoting contacts, and identifying mutual interests
                            on which we can work together for mutual profit. In ruminating over our
                            policy we have evolved some “Considerations in Supplying Yugoslavs
                            Materiel” as a guideline (attached) for use at the working level in
                            Defense. We probably have gone about as far as we can within existing
                            policy limitations, which we are planning to reconsider during 1973.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_VIP1">VIP</gloss> Visits Logical Next Step</p>
                        <p>(C) The groundwork has been laid for several key visits during 1973 and
                            1974. General Ryan, <gloss target="#t_CSAF1">CSAF</gloss>, may visit
                            Yugoslavia in the Spring or Summer of 1973. As you know, a SecDef visit
                            has been discussed for over a year. An earlier invitation to Secretary
                            Laird was aborted when the Yugoslavs extended a formal invitation to
                            Soviet <gloss target="#t_MOD1">MOD</gloss> Grechko after offering an
                            “unofficial” invitation to Mr. Laird. The Yugoslavs have since indicated
                            informally that they would like you to visit in the Summer or Fall 1973
                            or later.</p>
                        <p>(C) There are a few cautions to keep in mind when considering the value
                            of the projected <gloss target="#t_VIP1">VIP</gloss> visits during 1973:
                            (1) The Yugoslavs find <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> friendship
                            valuable, but they will be cautious; they will not enter into
                            arrangements which will expose their leadership vulnerabilities or
                            internal problems; (2) <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> disregard of
                            Yugoslav sensitivities could jeopardize closer military cooperation and
                            (3) Areas of political disagreement in which the Yugoslav military does
                            not figure at all, simply should be avoided. With these factors in mind,
                            a trip by you to visit Yugoslavia, when an official invitation is
                            received, could well serve a useful purpose.</p>

                        <p>In response to your request for a brief report on the current status of
                            our relations with Yugoslavia and <gloss target="#t_US1"

                            recent months, and a review of pending <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            policy decisions relating to Yugoslavia in the political, economic,
                            scientific, and military fields, including proposed exchanges of
                            high-level visits, the Under Secretaries Committee is submitting this
                            memorandum, which covers a more detailed report.</p>
                        <p>Discussion</p>
                        <p>The Committee believes that the several recent instances of friction in
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Yugoslav bilateral relations that
                            have arisen out of Yugoslavia's zeal as a non-aligned leader and out of
                            internally-motivated distortions carried by the Yugoslav press are
                            relatively superficial when viewed against the larger background of
                            constructive developments in our relations. These differences should not
                            be allowed to obscure the larger <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            interest in the continued independence and unity of Yugoslavia,
                            particularly at a time when Yugoslavia undergoes the stresses and
                            strains of strengthening its institutions in preparation for the <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="d59-02" facs="d59-02"/>inevitable departure of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> from the scene.
                            Periodic exchanges of high-level visits can help moderate the rhetoric
                            in those matters where our positions are different, and generally
                            enhance bilateral cooperation to our joint advantage.</p>
                        <p>The Committee does not view the course of Yugoslav foreign policy in
                            recent months as indicating any change in Yugoslavia's basic policies of
                            resisting Soviet control, seeking improved relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and other Western countries, and
                            maintaining a non-aligned posture. The main emphasis in the internal
                            policies of the Yugoslav leadership of late has been on strengthening
                            the central authority of the governing League of Communists as a check
                            on disruptive manifestations of regional nationalisms stimulated by a
                            decentralization program undertaken several years ago. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s efforts have met with some
                            opposition, but he is convinced they are essential to the stability of
                            the Government, and stability is a result we would welcome.</p>
                        <p>The Committee views the Yugoslav military as a major cohesive force and
                            one that can be expected to play a major role in maintaining Yugoslav
                            unity with the passing of the <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> era. We also expect that during <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s lifetime, this role will
                            continue to be subordinate to the Communist Party (<gloss
                                target="#t_LCY1">LCY</gloss>), exerting a stabilizing influence from
                            a distance and in low profile. After <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName>, the role of the military in defending national
                            unity may well become more pronounced.</p>
                        <p>The gradual improvement in exchanges between the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and Yugoslav military establishments achieved in recent
                            years could be further enhanced by a visit to Yugoslavia of our new
                            Secretary of Defense, as soon as this is feasible. The Departments of
                            State and Defense are actively considering methods by which exceptions
                            to the National Disclosure Policy could be obtained, to facilitate the
                            sale to the Yugoslavs of certain carefully-selected military items thus
                            far denied to them on security considerations.</p>
                        <p>The Yugoslavs have also invited the Secretaries of the Treasury,
                            Commerce, Agriculture, the <gloss target="#t_USIA1">USIA</gloss>
                            Director, and our Special Trade Representative to visit Yugoslavia
                            whenever convenient. Such visits <pb n="3" xml:id="d59-03" facs="d59-03"
                            />properly spaced during the next eighteen months would be helpful to
                            the advancement of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interests. These
                            include specifically the growth of trade and economic cooperation and
                            the continuation of our active information and cultural programs in
                            Yugoslavia, neither of which have been negatively affected by recent
                            frictions.</p>
                        <p>With regard to future high-level Yugoslav visits to Washington, in July
                            1972 Yugoslav Premier <persName corresp="#p_BD3">Bijedic</persName>
                            expressed the hope to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1"
                                >Rogers</persName> that he might be able to visit the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> sometime in 1973. You decided earlier
                            this year that your schedule for 1973 would not permit receiving the
                            Yugoslav Premier this year, but we have held off notifying him pending
                            decision about prospects for 1974.</p>
                        <p>Recommendation:</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretaries unanimously recommend:</p>
                        <p>that you authorize our Ambassador to express your regret to the Yugoslav
                            head of government, Premier <persName corresp="#p_BD3"
                                >Bijedic</persName>, that it was not possible to schedule a visit
                            with him in Washington for 1973, to carry forward the useful exchanges
                            of high-level visits that have contributed effectively to the
                            development of friendly relations in recent years, but that (A) you hope
                            to be able to propose a date later this year for a visit in early 1974
                            or that (B) you can at this point propose a visit for a given period in
                            early 1974.</p>
                        <p>Approve A</p>
                        <p>Approve B</p>

                            <p>Summary</p>
                            <p>The Under Secretaries Committee has reviewed the current status of
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Yugoslav relations, including
                                economic, scientific-technical, information-cultural, and military
                                exchanges and cooperation, with particular attention to the
                                significance of the attitudes toward the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> displayed by Yugoslavia's leaders and by the media
                                since November 1972, as they may relate to pending policy decisions
                                and plans for high-level exchanges in the coming months.</p>
                            <p>The Committee believes that recent instances in which Yugoslav policy
                                actions were at odds with a <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                                objective, and in which media attacks were especially ill-founded,
                                have their causation in an atmosphere created by the Yugoslav
                                leadership's perception of (a) their internal political requirements
                                as that country prepares for the difficulties of the <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> succession, and (b) their
                                need to appear a leading member of the non-aligned nations.</p>
                            <p>Such policies and media distortions can and should be countered and
                                deterred, but in ways that take into account the larger <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interest in Yugoslavia maintaining
                                its independence and unity. The Committee favors continuation of the
                                cooperation, exchanges, and consultations that have characterized
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Yugoslav relations in recent
                                years, and recommends that our Ambassador be authorized to invite
                                the Yugoslav head of government, Premier <persName corresp="#p_BD3"
                                    >Bijedic</persName>, to visit Washington in early 1974, at
                                mutually-convenient dates.</p>
                            <p>The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> has important strategic and
                                political interest in the continued existence of a stable,
                                independent, non-aligned and economically-viable Yugoslavia. <pb
                                    n="6" xml:id="d59-06" facs="d59-06"/>Strategically, a
                                non-aligned Yugoslavia helps to protect the southern flank of <gloss
                                    target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and contributes to the general
                                security of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners. An
                                independent Yugoslavia continues to provide a highly desirable
                                example to other Communist countries by resisting Soviet control,
                                actively seeking closer relations with the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss>, and evolving moderated policies aimed at
                                decentralized government and a market-oriented socialist economy.
                                The Committee does not view the course of Yugoslav internal and
                                foreign policies since 1971 as changed in any of these essentials,
                                and believes that such frictions as have developed in our relations
                                of late are more than offset by an increased capacity on the part of
                                the Yugoslav Government to cope with the strains of the coming
                                succession period.</p>
                            <p>Externally, Yugoslav relations with the Soviet Union have much
                                improved over the 1968 level. This improvement was aided by the
                                general reduction in East-West tensions and the Soviet tactic of
                                avoiding criticism of Yugoslav deviations and of offering
                                developmental credits. It is clear also that the Yugoslavs believe
                                better relations with the Soviet Union will help inhibit Soviet
                                trouble-making during the difficult <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                    >Tito</persName> succession period. Not-withstanding this
                                improvement, Yugoslav trade and cultural ties with Western Europe
                                and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> continue to predominate
                                over those with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and its
                                Warsaw Pact allies.</p>
                            <p>Particularly since November 1972, it has been the Yugoslav zeal in
                                support of the non-aligned world that put the Yugoslav Government in
                                a more pro-<gloss target="#t_PRG1">PRG</gloss>, pro-Palestinian,
                                pro-Egyptian, and pro-Panamanian posture than is readily compatible
                                with <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> objectives in seeing the
                                Vietnamese, Middle East and Panamanian issues settled by
                                negotiations.</p>
                            <p>The recent emphasis on Yugoslav-Marxist orthodoxy, and Yugoslav
                                resentment of pessimistic and confidence-sapping analyses of
                                Yugoslav developments in the Western press, helped create an
                                atmosphere in which Yugoslav press and public criticism of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and other Western countries
                                became somewhat sharper in style than in recent years.</p>

                            <p>Nevertheless, these criticisms have often been balanced by other
                                positive treatment of international and bilateral issues which has
                                attracted less attention. The continuity of essential Yugoslav
                                policies was reasserted most authoritatively by <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> in a major internal and
                                foreign policy speech to the Yugoslav Federal Assembly and the
                                leadership of all mass organizations April 23, 1973, in which the
                                Yugoslav President stressed maintenance of Yugoslavia's independent
                                and nonaligned course, and deplored speculation abroad to the
                                contrary. The Committee believes that the moderate tenor of this
                                speech confirms other indications that the Ministry of Foreign
                                Affairs by now has concluded correctly from our protests that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government will not remain
                                silently acquiescent when our interests are abused, even though we
                                do not expect the non-aligned Yugoslav Government to agree with and
                                support all of our positions or actions.</p>
                            <pb n="8" xml:id="d59-08" facs="d59-08"/>
                            <p>The Committee has observed that underneath the surface noise,
                                internal consolidation of the Party and the new emphasis on
                                non-aligned positions have had no significant effect limiting the
                                ability of the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> effectively to
                                pursue its political, military, economic, informational, cultural,
                                and scientific cooperation objectives in and with Yugoslavia.
                                Nevertheless, the Yugoslav Government will need to be reminded on
                                occasion that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> goodwill should not
                                always be taken for granted. It will be in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss> interest to react to, and better yet,
                                foresee and deter Yugoslav actions adverse to our interests, but not
                                to over-react to a degree that would harm the long-term and
                                principal <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> objectives.</p>
                            <p>These <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-objectives are well served by
                                high-level visits. In recommending that Premier <persName

                                Washington, the Committee notes (1) that no Yugoslav head of
                                government (as distinct from <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                    >Tito</persName> who visited here in 1971 as chief of state) has
                                yet visited Washington and (2) that when the subject was first
                                discussed between <persName corresp="#p_BD3">Bijedic</persName> and
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWP1">Rogers</persName> in Belgrade
                                in July 1972, it was hoped that the visit could be scheduled
                                sometime in 1973.</p>
                            <p>Both countries share an interest in an improved relationship between
                                our respective military establishments, no longer the relationship
                                based on massive <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> grant assistance
                                as in the 1950's, but one in which mutual understanding is promoted
                                by the exchange of visits. A visit by the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                    >US</gloss> Secretary of Defense could contribute to enhancing
                                this relationship.</p>
                            <p>Other visits could include those of the Secretaries of the Treasury,

                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d60-02" facs="d60-02"/>
                        <p>(C) During the past few years the Government of Yugoslavia has sought to
                            obtain technical data on sensitive or classified weapons and technology
                            from the United States which we have been unwilling to provide due to
                            general policy considerations or security restrictions. Some modest
                            purchase requests have also been received. Up to this time, our offers
                            to provide arms to Yugoslavia have been limited to unclassified items,
                            and no classified technical data have been released (see Tab A). The
                            Yugoslavs have been disappointed with our unwillingness to respond to
                            questions concerning classified data which is not releasable to
                            Yugoslavia. Also, the Yugoslavs have complained about long delays in
                            receiving even negative responses to their requests.</p>
                        <p>(C) The issue is whether, under present policy considerations, we should
                            modify our security restrictions in order to broaden our military supply
                            to Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>(C) The purpose of this paper is to establish guidance which may be used
                            as a basis for making exceptions to the National Disclosure Policy for
                            Yugoslavia. Such exceptions should be based upon a determination that
                            the release of certain classified data and material to Yugoslavia is
                            clearly within the national interest as illustrated in the following
                            discussion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> POLICY OBJECTIVES</p>
                        <p>(C) The U.S. has an important stake in the survival of an independent and
                            non-aligned Yugoslavia, threatened realistically in the next ten to
                            fifteen years only by the Soviet Union. This U.S. interest was affirmed
                            explicitly by President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> in
                            the Joint Statement issued by the President and <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> in October 1971 (text at Tab
                            B).</p>
                        <p>(C) The location of Yugoslavia in southeastern Europe with a border on
                            the Adriatic bears strongly on major U.S. strategic interests in the
                            Mediterranean region, in protecting the southern flank of <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and in protecting the territorial
                            integrity of our <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> partners in
                            central Europe. An independent Yugoslavia has led the way among the
                            communist countries of eastern Europe in remaining outside the Soviet
                            bloc since 1948, in seeking closer relations with the U.S., and in
                            evolving moderated policies aimed at a decentralized government and a
                            market-oriented economy.</p>
                        <p>(C) A Yugoslavia territory free of Soviet bases serves important U.S.
                            strategic interests in the Eastern Mediterranean. As long as Yugoslavia
                            is able to maintain its political independence of Moscow and its own
                            economic prosperity, it has an excellent chance of maintaining an
                            independent, “nonaligned” national policy. If the U.S. and the West can
                            offer Yugoslavia alternate sources of military supplies, the traditional
                            Yugoslav independent outlook is enhanced, further promoting U.S.
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>(C) <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>, the symbol of national
                            unity in Yugoslavia, will be 81 in May. His departure may precipitate a
                            succession crisis in which the Yugoslav military is certain to play a
                            major role in holding the country together. The U.S. military once had
                            extensive influence and personal contact with the Yugoslav military
                            during the 1951-1957 period of a U.S. military assistance program.
                            However, with the discontinuance of our military assistance program in
                            Yugoslavia the influence and contacts were dissipated. Until recently,
                            our direct contact with the Yugoslav military had been minimal.</p>
                        <p>(C) After the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslav officials and
                            military functionaries once again began looking to the West for support.
                            None are anti-Communists; they are, however, nationalists prepared to
                            fight for Yugoslav independence. They need some concrete evidence that
                            friends exist in influential places in the West who understand the
                            special Yugoslav position with respect to the Communist world. It is
                            especially vital now, as we approach the end of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> era, to instill confidence in
                            them and to develop special relationships and channels which could be
                            exploited to serve U.S. national interests. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> may remain long enough to permit full development
                            of these relationships; the post-<persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> period may be too late.</p>
                        <p>YUGOSLAV ARMS PROCUREMENT</p>
                        <p>(C) Yugoslavia has turned both to the East and West for arms procurement
                            since World War II. Moscow provided military equipment and training
                            until Belgrade's 1948 break with the Cominform. Yugoslavia then turned
                            to the West for military assistance and for the next decade obtained
                            most of its military equipment from the U.S. During this period, we
                            furnished some $700 million in grant military assistance. The Yugoslavs,
                            however, chose as of 1957 not to renew the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> assistance agreement
                            and it expired in 1961. The Soviet Union again became Yugoslavia's
                            primary foreign arms supplier, notably with high performance aircraft,
                            armor and SAM antiaircraft weaponry.</p>
                        <p>(C) Although the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 strained
                            Belgrade's relations with Moscow, the Soviet supply relationship was
                            maintained. Yugoslavia is, however, seeking to reduce its dependence on
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> for sophisticated weaponry.
                            Contacts have been made with the U.S. and other western countries in
                            recent years to diversify sources of supply.</p>
                        <p>DEVELOPMENT OF <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-YUGOSLAV MILITARY
                            RELATIONS</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d60-03" facs="d60-03"/>
                        <p>(C) We have undertaken a low-key program to improve relationships between
                            the U.S. and Yugoslav military. Our purpose is to develop a
                            military-to-military relationship which may serve as an important means
                            to assure the <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> of U.S. interest in
                            Yugoslavia, including support for Yugoslavia's continued independence
                            and necessary defense posture.</p>
                        <p>(C) In 1970, just prior to President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1"
                                >Nixon</persName>'s Belgrade visit, the Assistant Secretary of
                            Defense for International Security Affairs, <persName corresp="#p_NGW1"
                                >G. Warren Nutter</persName>, visited Yugoslavia, with State
                            Department approval, in pursuit of a program of closer contacts with the
                            Yugoslav military. The guiding principle established at that time, and
                            in effect today, is that the Yugoslavs would choose a tempo in military
                            contacts with which they would be comfortable. Over the last three years
                            the exchange of contacts has gradually matured. The first Yugoslav
                            military delegation visited the U.S. in September 1971, headed by Major
                            General Kadijevic. Colonel General Dolnicar, Assistant State Secretary
                            for National Defense, was the guest of Dr. <persName corresp="#p_NGW1"
                                >Nutter</persName> in May of 1972. A. U.S. Army team, led by Major
                            General E.B. Roberts, Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Military
                            Operations, visited Yugoslavia in November 1972. A visit by the
                            Secretary of Defense in late 1973 is under consideration.</p>
                        <p>(U) There are two Yugoslav officers now attending the Army Command and
                            General Staff College; two Yugoslav officers will enter the Air Command
                            and General Staff College this summer; and a U.S. Army officer is
                            currently attending school in Belgrade as part of the Foreign Area
                            Specialist Program, the second such student in as many years.</p>
                        <p>(C) Out of these exchanges a greater understanding and mutual frankness
                            has evolved between our military. These favorable developments have been
                            made at little cost, and common U.S. and Yugoslav military goals have
                            been promoted. During every visit mentioned above, the subject of U.S.
                            arms and equipment sales was discussed.</p>
                        <p>ROBERTS MISSION REPORT</p>
                        <p>(C) As a result of discussions with various Yugoslav military
                            representatives during his trip to Yugoslavia, General ROBERTS reported
                            that, although they were disappointed so far with the results of their
                            efforts to obtain information on classified items from the U.S., they
                            continue to hope to obtain certain information on advanced technology
                            and equipment on which to base procurement decisions.</p>
                        <p>(C) In his report, General ROBERTS emphasized that the obstacle to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> procurement of U.S. defense articles
                            and technical data is security classification, and that only by
                            recognizing Yugoslavia's special status in the communist world and its
                            relationship to the U.S. could this obstacle be removed. (Embassy
                            Belgrade endorsed General ROBERTS' report.)</p>
                        <p>YUGOSLAV OBJECTIVES</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d60-04" facs="d60-04"/>
                        <p>(C) The Yugoslav military have made very plain that they want to buy
                            military equipment from the United States. Colonel General Susnjar,
                            Chief of Procurement of the Yugoslav General Staff, has said: “We want
                            sincerely to buy equipment from you and do business with the United
                            States, but frankly we just haven't been able to get anywhere because
                            you make it so difficult for us.” However, specific interests of the
                            Yugoslavs for arms purchases have been difficult to determine, partly
                            because their requests have been unclear to us and partly because we
                            have been unable to seek a clarification since the dialogue would have
                            to include classified information, up till now denied to the
                            Yugoslavs.</p>
                        <p>(C) A second possible Yugoslav objective may be the purchase of U.S.
                            production models, technical information and data packages in order to
                            expand their arms industry. General ROBERTS came away with the
                            impression that the Yugoslavs may be nearly as interested in the
                            manufacture and sale of arms to the U.S. and third countries as they are
                            in purchases from the U.S. Yugoslav motivation to expand its arms
                            industry increases its self-reliance while also strengthening its
                            independent economy.</p>
                        <p>(C) However, these apparent Yugoslav objectives coincide only partially
                            with our own. We want to sell arms to Yugoslavia; we are willing to
                            provide enough technical information upon which procurement decisions
                            may be made; however, it cannot be our general policy to provide
                            technical data packages which are not necessary for Yugoslav procurement
                            decisions but could form the basis for Yugoslav production. To assure
                            mutual understanding, we should make this policy clear to the
                            Yugoslavs.</p>
                        <p>(C) The U.S. has no direct policy interest in the expansion of the
                            Yugoslav arms industry nor in sales to third parties of military
                            articles produced in Yugoslavia with <gloss target="#t_US1"
                            >US</gloss>-supplied technology. We have no interest now in purchasing
                            Yugoslav arms; and there appears to be no likelihood for any <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> arms
                            barter agreements. Approval of a technology transfer should be based on
                            an assessment that it aids the Yugoslavs to decide on arms purchases.
                            Should, however, any transfer of technology be considered advisable
                            beyond this constraint, there should be a clear Yugoslav understanding
                            that any production resulting from such transfer will be for maintenance
                            support of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-origin equipment and for
                            use of the Yugoslav forces only.</p>
                        <p>THE SECURITY ASPECT</p>
                        <p>(C) Under the provisions of the National Disclosure Policy, Yugoslavia is
                            ineligible to receive classified military items unless the Secretaries
                            of State and Defense jointly, or the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of
                            Defense, or the National Military Information Disclosure Policy
                            Committee (<gloss target="#t_NDPC1">NDPC</gloss>) approves an exception
                            to provide the classified military information <pb n="5" xml:id="d60-05"
                                facs="d60-05"/>pertaining to such items. An exception to the
                            National Disclosure Policy is initiated by a request to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NDPC1">NDPC</gloss> based on U.S. policy interests in a
                            certain country and may be limited to certain levels and categories of
                            classified information. After consideration of the circumstances (the
                            policy, country, items involved, risk of compromise), the <gloss
                                target="#t_NDPC1">NDPC</gloss> decides whether to authorize the
                            release of the information and such considerations as whether a Security
                            of Information Agreement (which amounts to a pledge to handle U.S.
                            classified items as the U.S. would itself) is required as a prerequisite
                            to such a release. U.S. Embassy Belgrade has recommended against a
                            Security of Information Agreement with <gloss target="#t_GOY1"
                                >GOY</gloss> because the Ambassador believes that the agreement
                            would have little relevance and also little chance of being signed by
                                <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss>. (See Tab C)</p>
                        <p>(C) We consider it safe to assume that the security apparatus of
                            Yugoslavia is as efficient as in other Communist countries. Therefore,
                            the question is not the usual one of whether the system works, but the
                            amount of risk of disclosure to the Soviet Union. The fact that
                            Yugoslavia considers the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as the
                            greatest potential threat to its independence in itself argues against
                                <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> disclosure of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-provided classified items since
                            disclosure would be clearly detrimental to Yugoslav interest in case of
                            a Soviet attack. The passing of secrets by individuals cannot be ruled
                            out, but the <gloss target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> security organs are
                            active in the sensitive area of military security. Embassy Belgrade has
                            emphasized that on the basis of their history alone, the Yugoslavs could
                            be expected to protect the security of U.S. classified items with
                            “scrupulous care” (Tab C).</p>
                        <p>CONCLUSIONS</p>
                        <p>(C) In view of the U.S. interest in the maintenance of an independent,
                            non-aligned Yugoslavia, we should be responsive to <gloss
                                target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> efforts to find a meaningful
                            alternative to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as a source of
                            supply of military items.</p>
                        <p>(C) U.S. security policy preventing the supply of classified defense
                            articles and technical information has been an irritant in our relations
                            with Yugoslavia and interferes with our objectives toward Yugoslavia.
                            These security obstacles should be reduced, though not completely
                            removed. Exceptions to the National Disclosure Policy should be sought
                            in order to provide Yugoslavia with classified items on a selective
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>(C) U.S. policy should continue to emphasize the direct sale of defensive
                            articles rather than to provide pure technology to Yugoslavia. In cases
                            where the sale of military end items or the transfer of technology are
                            judged advisable, these types of transfer should be governed by a
                            careful assessment of the contribution which would be made to the
                            defensive capability of the Yugoslav armed forces; any production of
                            classified U.S. end items will generally not be encouraged.</p>

                        <p>Yugoslavia is a divided and deeply troubled land and may become even more
                            so when the aged and ailing <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
                            departs the scene. But this Estimate concludes that, even without
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>, the odds favor the
                            survival of the Yugoslav federation and a hybrid, non-Soviet form of
                            socialism. Impressive efforts are now being made to arrange an orderly
                            succession to <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>, to build up
                            Stane Dolanc as the heir apparent, and to transform the declining
                            Yugoslav communist party into an effective national force.</p>
                        <p>The odds do not favor direct Soviet intervention in post-Tito Yugoslavia.
                            Moscow lacks significant assets within Yugoslav society, understands
                            that strong pressures against Belgrade are likely only to drive it
                            westwards, and does not conceive of the restoration of Soviet dominance
                            over Yugoslavia as a vital interest. Even in the event of serious
                            disruptions in Yugoslavia, Moscow&amp;mdash;at least so long as its
                            policy of detente in the West persists&amp;mdash;would be more likely to
                            try to quarantine the trouble than to become directly involved in it.
                            Finally, the costs and risks for the Soviets of a military campaign
                            against Yugoslavia would be high and the stakes simply
                            incommensurate.</p>
                        <p>These judgments cannot be made without qualifications, however, because
                            the chances of post-Tito turmoil and the danger of subsequent Soviet
                            intervention are not insignificant. No one knows what this peculiar
                            Balkan state will look like once the unifying force of <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s dominating presence has
                            disappeared, and no one can predict the precise circumstances which
                            might push or pull the Soviets into direct involvement. But Western
                            reactions to the threat of that involvement would have much to do with
                            whether or not it was carried out and, indeed, with the future course of
                            Soviet-Western relations in general.</p>

                            system&amp;mdash;can scarcely yet be viewed as an assured success. There
                            are severe flaws and faults in Yugoslav society, and in <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s grand design for it. And it has
                            recently become clear that Tito himself, now an ailing 81, will from now
                            on be able to play only a diminished role in the nation's political
                            life.1 Whether the “Yugoslav Experiment” can survive without

                            single entity without his leadership&amp;mdash;is now a real question.
                            And this question faces not only Yugoslavia but other powers as well,

                            is a chronic, slowly progressive, generalized cerebrovascular and
                            cardiovascular atherosclerosis associated with high blood pressure.
                            There is evidence that brief episodes of acute cronary insufficiency are
                            precipitated by transient increase of his already elevated blood
                            pressure and result in congestive heart failure and a period of marked
                            reduction in physical competence.</p>

                        <p>The Current Domestic Scene</p>
                        <p>2. The ethnic terrain of Yugoslavia is the most varied and complex in
                            Europe. Few Yugoslavs are, in fact, Yugoslavs first; they are Serbs or
                            Croats or Montenegrins and only secondarily Yugoslavs.2 Antagonisms
                            between these diverse nationalities have persisted for centuries and
                            even now underlie most of the country's political and social problems
                            and not a few of the economic ones as well.</p>
                        <p>2) Of Yugoslavia's total population of about 21 million, about 40 percent
                            are Serb, 22 percent Croat, 8 1/2 percent Bosnian Muslim, 8 percent
                            Slovene, 6 percent Macedonian, 6 1/2 percent Albanian, 2 1/2 percent
                            Montenegrin, 2 percent Hungarian, and the remainder miscellaneous.</p>
                        <p>3. For roughly 20 years, the Titoist notion of how best to deal with the
                            forces of divisive nationalism and with the regional urges for greater
                            independence was, in effect, to accommodate them. Emphasis was on
                            decentralization&amp;mdash;political, economic, even to some extent
                            military. The Communist Party (the League of Communists of
                            Yugoslavia&amp;mdash;LCY) sought only diffidently to lead and became
                            largely provincial in outlook, more often than not representing the
                            republics in Belgrade rather than vice versa. At the same time, federal
                            governmental structures retreated from active participation in many
                            areas of national life, their political and economic powers either
                            withering away or passing on to republican or regional governments,
                            economic enterprises, and worker organizations.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d61-04" facs="d61-04"/>
                        <p>4. The decline of Yugoslav federal power no doubt did help to appease
                            certain nationalist appetites. But for most of this period, the
                            principal national cement (other than Tito's own authority) was the
                            elemental fear of Yugoslavs everywhere that they and their individual
                            republics and their country as a whole were menaced by a hostile outside
                            power, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. But by mid or late
                            1971 jitters over a possible post-Czechoslovak Soviet invasion of
                            Yugoslavia had faded and fears of general Soviet intentions had receded.
                            This recession, coming at a time when the power of central party and
                            state officials was at its nadir, allowed nationalists in Croatia to win
                            wide support and in late 1971 to provoke the worst crisis of its kind in
                            the postwar era. The subsequent inability of authorities in both Zagreb
                            and Belgrade to control demonstrations and to impose discipline within
                            ruling circles caught Tito and the top leadership almost completely off
                            guard. The crisis was overcome only through (for Yugoslavia) a Draconian
                            crackdown&amp;mdash;some 800 functionaries were purged&amp;mdash;and the
                            direct personal intervention of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> himself.</p>
                        <p>5. This crisis marked a turning point in Yugoslav domestic affairs. It
                            began the current period of retrenchment, intended in the main to
                            curtail the autonomy of the individual republics, to reassert the
                            authority of the central organs of the <gloss target="#t_LCY1"
                                >LCY</gloss>, and to do all this while the great national father
                            figure, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>, is still
                            ultimately in command. Tito does not plan to abandon the fundamentals of
                            the Yugoslav course: “pluralistic” socialism, international
                            non-alignment, and national sovereignty. But he now feels that only a
                            strong, reinvigorated national party can carry on in his
                            absence&amp;mdash;preserve the Titoist tradition, guard Yugoslav
                            independence, and prevent federal disintegration.</p>
                        <p>6. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> of course faces more
                            problems than nationality conflicts in the body politic. The Yugoslav
                            economy is still in trouble.3 Inflation is running at about 20 percent
                            this year and imports are still outracing exports. Many individual
                            enterprises are still grossly inefficient by Western standards. A much
                            heralded economic stabilization program introduced last December has
                            already stimulated widespread dissatisfaction and is bogging down. The
                            southern republics are still backward and the more prosperous
                            northerners still resent having to help them out. And the rate of
                            unemployment&amp;mdash;especially in the underdeveloped
                            south&amp;mdash;remains high, despite the large-scale emigration of
                            Yugoslav workers to Western Europe. (Remittances from these workers have
                            become crucial to the balance of payments, offsetting a major share of
                            the deficit in Yugoslavia's trade with the West and helping to meet
                            repayments on an external debt now totaling almost $3.6 billion.)</p>
                        <p>3) With a per capita gross national product (<gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                                >GNP</gloss>) estimated at about $860 in 1970, Yugoslavia has one of
                            the least developed European economies&amp;mdash;about on a par with
                            Greece, less than that of Bulgaria ($1,300), and about one-half that of
                            Italy. The per capita <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> in Slovenia,
                            the richest republic, is about $1,550&amp;mdash;five times higher than
                            that in the autonomous province of Kosovo, the most backward area.</p>

                        <p>7. Until the crisis in Croatia, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName>'s arrangements for the succession seemed in some
                            respects more ritual than reality. The essential elements in his program
                            included a devolution of his own enormous personal power to collective
                            bodies composed of important republican leaders and the division of
                            authority between various party, central government, parliamentarian,
                            provincial, and economic institutions. Emphasis was in large part placed
                            on mechanical devices intended to prevent an excessive accumulation of
                            power by one man or one region.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d61-05" facs="d61-05"/>
                        <p>8. Since the Croatian crisis, however, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> has decreed a more political and less mechanical
                            approach. Purges have in <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s
                            view helped to remove from power the worst of the republican
                            nationalists and <gloss target="#t_LCY1">LCY</gloss> liberals. (The
                            latter have also sought a weakening of central authority.) Further
                            efforts have been made to improve the organization and functioning of
                            party and state organs, with an eye to streamlining unwieldy structures.
                            An energetic campaign is underway at all levels to reassert the party's
                            dominance over other elements in society (including the military) and
                            its control over all questions of national policy. Perhaps most
                            important, one man, <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Stane Dolanc</persName>,
                            has emerged in recent months as the number two party leader and as the
                            most likely to succeed <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> in
                            the number one spot. <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> not

                            he holds close ties with the military and with military
                            counterintelligence; apparently does not inspire any particular
                            antipathies within the <gloss target="#t_LCY1">LCY</gloss>; and, as a
                            Slovene, is not ethnically unacceptable to the other nationalities.</p>
                        <p>9. It is possible of course that the recent changes and modifications in
                            Yugoslav succession arrangements have come too late. The <gloss
                                target="#t_LCY1">LCY</gloss> is not likely again to become the kind
                            of dedicated, disciplined, unifying force it once was. It will almost
                            certainly not be able (or eager) to play a conventionally dictatorial
                            communist role, in part because the concepts and practices of the whole
                            Titoist political and economic system would have to be destroyed
                            first—over the dead bodies of other important elements in Yugoslav
                            society. The <gloss target="#t_LCY1">LCY</gloss> will thus have to
                            continue to accommodate itself to the often divisive pressures of a
                            pluralist society. But the party seems to be the only all-national
                            institution, other than the army, which is even potentially capable of
                            binding the state together at home and enabling Yugoslavia to carry on a
                            vigorously independent policy abroad. And it can and probably will come
                            to play a more effective role than it has in the recent past.</p>

                        <p>10. Soviet-Yugoslav relations have followed a cyclical course since the
                            death of Stalin in 1953, the quality of the relationship depending in
                            the main on Moscow's willingness to accept Yugoslav independence or,
                            conversely, its willingness to threaten that independence (as, for
                            example, implicitly, in its actions elsewhere in Eastern Europe). The
                            most recent low point was reached in the late 1960s after the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s invasion of Czechoslovakia.
                            Relations have been on the mend for the past two years or so, however,
                            largely as a consequence of <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName>'s decision in mid-1971 to go to Yugoslavia,
                            there to praise Tito, to endorse Yugoslav sovereignty, and to offer the
                            country generous new amounts of economic assistance.4</p>
                        <p>4) The credit actually extended totaled $540 million, little of which has
                            as yet been drawn (partly because of Soviet-Yugoslav disagreements
                            concerning terms).</p>
                        <p>11. The <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> leadership seems
                            to have been generally pleased by developments in Yugoslavia over the
                            past year or so, particularly the crackdown on liberals, the reassertion
                            of party power, and the decline in anti-Soviet propaganda. It also seems
                            to have concluded that, if the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is
                            to be in a good position to influence the course of events in Yugoslavia
                            after <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> goes, then it must
                            seek to establish cordial relations during the period preceding his
                            departure. This approach is of course wholly consistent with, and
                            perhaps a part of, the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s larger
                            policy of detente in Europe and toward the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>. At the very least, the requirements of this
                            policy&amp;mdash;including a general lack of tension on the
                            continent&amp;mdash;encourage restraint in the Soviet stance <pb n="6"
                                xml:id="d61-06" facs="d61-06"/>vis-a-vis Yugoslavia. And so long as
                            Moscow's desire for detente persists&amp;mdash;which it is likely to do
                            for quite some time to come 5&amp;mdash;Yugoslavia will remain an
                            indirect beneficiary of it.</p>
                        <p>5) See NIE 11-9-73, “The Soviet Approach to Summit II,” dated 1 June
                            1973, SECRET, paragraphs 1-4.</p>
                        <p>12. Still, there are a variety of reasons why Moscow would welcome
                            Yugoslavia's reincorporation into the Soviet Bloc. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s break with the Cominform in
                            1948 is still remembered within the Soviet Communist Party as a painful
                            ideological and political shock. Should post-Tito Yugoslavia re-embrace
                            the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, the Soviets would see their
                            view of the “socialist world” as reaffirmed. They would also see the
                            Soviet position in Eastern Europe as strengthened, (especially in
                            Romania), the Soviet strategic posture (particularly
                            vis-&amp;agrave;-vis Italy and the Mediterranean) as improved, and their
                            long and frustrating quarrel with a major heretic as having ended in
                            triumph.</p>
                        <p>13. But if there are reasons why the Soviets might wish for Yugoslavia's
                            reincorporation, there are also many constraints on their willingness
                            and ability to bring it about.</p>
                        <p>&amp;mdash;What happens inside Yugoslavia and what Yugoslavia does for
                            itself internationally are no longer (as they are, for example, in the
                            case of Czechoslovakia) vital concerns of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. There thus are major self-imposed restrictions on the
                            risks the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be willing to run
                            and the costs it would be ready to pay.</p>
                        <p>&amp;mdash;The political means available to the Soviets to further their
                            objectives are in any case limited. Soviet influence inside Yugoslavia
                            is not substantial (and may be less than that of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the West European states). Moscow
                            does not seem to possess any particular assets within the Yugoslav
                            establishment and cannot count on any substantial body of opinion
                            peculiarly sympathetic to the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> or
                            to the Soviet variety of communism.</p>
                        <p>&amp;mdash;Although only 11 percent of Yugoslavia's total trade is with
                            the Soviet Union (and less than a third with <gloss target="#t_CEMA1"
                                >CEMA</gloss> as a whole), the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            could exert some economic leverage&amp;mdash;it is a significant market
                            for Yugoslav goods and is a major source of industrial credits for the
                            more backward Yugoslav regions&amp;mdash;especially important if the
                            West were to turn its back on Yugoslavia in a post-<persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> balance of payments crunch. The
                            Soviets are, in addition, the major outside supplier of military
                            hardware to the Yugoslav armed forces. Belgrade, however, is trying to
                            diversify its sources of supply, and Soviet economic or military
                            leverage would in any case almost certainly prove to be ineffective in a
                            time of Soviet-Yugoslav tension, especially in view of a probable
                            Western willingness to help out during such a period.</p>
                        <p>&amp;mdash;The Soviets could of course apply military pressure against
                            Yugoslavia, but the chances of backfire in this event would be
                            considerable. The Yugoslavs would almost certainly unite in resisting
                            such pressures, and they would, as before, turn to the West for
                            political support and material aid. If the Soviets actually invaded
                            Yugoslavia, they would have to allow for the probability of stiff
                            initial resistance by the Yugoslav Army and prolonged opposition by
                            sizable forces of well-armed irregulars (animated by the traditions of
                            partisan warfare during World War II). Moscow would thus need to build
                            an invasion force of some 30 divisions (or more), a task which would
                            require a substantial mobilization within the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, a drawdown of units opposite <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, or both.</p>
                        <p>&amp;mdash;Even if Soviet military operations against Yugoslavia
                            proceeded successfully, and without Western military reactions, an
                            invasion <pb n="7" xml:id="d61-07" facs="d61-07"/>of Yugoslavia would
                            severely, perhaps irreparably, damage a wide variety of Soviet interests
                            elsewhere. It would reverse the improvement in <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>-Soviet relations, hurt the Soviet image in the Third
                            World, and risk a closer <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Chinese

                            imports of technology, and its efforts to reduce the <gloss

                            acting within its own sphere of influence. An invasion of Yugoslavia
                            would not be quick, would be bloody, and would take Soviet troops beyond
                            the boundaries of Sovietized Europe.</p>

                                >Tito</persName>'s departure, Moscow is initially more likely to
                            react to specific events than to participate in them. But Moscow will
                            seek as best it can to prevent a westward shift in Yugoslavia's
                                post-<persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> posture and, if
                            possible, induce movement in the opposite direction.</p>
                        <p>15. The Soviet leaders might be tempted to add to any confusion in
                            Belgrade in the hope that a fluid or deteriorating political situation
                            would work to their advantage. And they might clandestinely encourage
                            separatist forces in the republics for the same reason. Stability in
                            Yugoslavia has not worked in their favor in the past, and their
                            prospects for developing assets within the country would improve during
                            a period of relative instability.</p>
                        <p>16. Nevertheless, there would be disadvantages for the Soviets if
                            confusion in Belgrade became turmoil, and separatism elsewhere in
                            Yugoslavia became the order of the day. Moscow would see dangers in
                            either eventuality: in the first because a drift toward anarchy in
                            Belgrade would eliminate or reduce the power of the central authorities
                            and organs which the Soviets believe might someday prove susceptible to
                            their influence, and might, in addition, eventually lead to a takeover
                            by the essentially anti-Soviet military; in the second because the
                            dismemberment of Yugoslavia along ethnic lines, aside from being
                            ideologically repugnant to the Soviets, would preclude the eventual
                            reincorporation of Yugoslavia, qua Yugoslavia, into the Bloc. Both
                            possibilities would, moreover, increase the chances of civil war, a
                            prospect that would force the Soviet leadership to choose between
                            staying out (and missing whatever opportunities for advancing its
                            interests the situation offered) or intervening (and running the risks
                            and incurring the costs that this would necessarily involve). Such a
                            choice could prove to be unsettling within the Soviet Politburo
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>17. Assuming that the Yugoslav regime remains generally effective and
                            carries on more or less in the Titoist tradition, Moscow is thus likely
                            to turn a generally amiable face toward post-Tito Yugoslavia, offering
                            economic assistance, military aid, and general cooperation, all at least
                            nominally without strings. This is the approach which seems to hold the
                            greatest promise of adding to Soviet prestige and influence in Belgrade
                            and the one which holds the least danger of propelling Belgrade toward
                            the West.</p>

                                >Dolanc</persName> as Secretary of the Executive Bureau (in effect,

                            officials and the federal bureaucracy will no doubt feel much the same
                            way; they will not in any case be in a position to challenge the party
                            authorities. The major republican leaders&amp;mdash;none of whom seem
                            now to represent militant nationality interests&amp;mdash;will also
                            serve in central bodies; this will at least for a time help to constrain
                            those among them who might be inclined to strike off on republican
                            tangents. Disaffected party personnel&amp;mdash;e.g., those who were
                            purged in the nation-wide wake of the Croatian crisis and those who seek
                            an ever-expanding democratization of national life&amp;mdash;will
                            probably not be able to combine into an effective opposition force for
                            quite some time after <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s
                            departure, if at all. 6</p>
                        <p>6) Other potential opposition forces&amp;mdash;Cominformists, Maoists,

                            capable of concerted action. Though they can be swayed by appeals to
                            regional nationalism, and could be aroused to protests in the event of
                            serious economic difficulties, the people at large do not otherwise
                            appear to be supporters of alternatives to the present system.</p>
                        <p>19. All things considered, the odds would seem to be that the Yugoslavs,
                            left to their own devices, will also be able over the longer term to
                            persist with one form or another of self-managed muddling through. The
                            Titoist heritage&amp;mdash;30 or so years of Yugoslav survival in the
                            face of war, cold war, and adversity&amp;mdash;will no doubt remain a
                            strong source of national pride. The single decentralized Yugoslav
                            economy, with all its problems, will continue to offer a greater return
                            than the individual and divided alternatives and thus will be seen to
                            provide the citizenry, the politicians, and even many of the
                            regionalists with a heavy stake in federal survival. Finally, the
                            concern that small individual successor states of the Yugoslav union
                            could not by themselves be either prosperous or secure will continue to
                            persuade many Yugoslavs that the unified state, in one form or another,
                            should be preserved.</p>
                        <p>20. The Yugoslav National Army is an important deterrent to a national
                            collapse. It is generally appreciated in Yugoslavia that, in the event
                            that conflicts threatened to erupt into civil war or to move the country
                            into anarchy, the military might step in to assert at least temporary
                            control. The Army was for a time, and may still prove to be, the only
                            all-national institutional force effectively functioning on the domestic
                            scene. Though not without its own problems, the Army seems as a whole to
                            be loyal to Tito, his system, and his concept of national integrity. It
                            has, in fact, demonstrated this on more than one occasion, most recently
                            during the Croatian crisis in 1971. Its loyalties after Tito is gone are
                            likely to be to those who promote a strong, cohesive Yugoslavia.</p>

                            over time, pull together and essentially in the same direction; that,
                            even if they do, they will be able to pull the republics along behind
                            them; or that the central authorities, as represented principally by
                            party functionaries, will be effective at provincial and local levels
                            and within individual economic enterprises. There is the possibility
                            that Belgrade's authority, even if never directly challenged, might
                            simply be ignored. There thus is a variety of conceivable contingencies
                            which could take place within Yugoslavia and which would have important
                            implications for Soviet (and Western) policies as well. Two
                            contingencies&amp;mdash;which are intended in broad outline to represent
                            plausible possibilities, but which do not seek to cover all or even most
                            conceivable alternatives&amp;mdash;are examined below:</p>
                        <p>Contingency A: A disintegrating Yugoslavia. In this instance, we
                            postulate a growth of nationality conflicts and economic difficulties
                            under a weak central regime. There is a breakdown in many areas of
                            federal influence and control, a divided leadership in Belgrade, and a
                            general move away from national integrity on all fronts. Many of the
                            functions of the center are assumed by the republics, which pursue their
                            own economic policies and even begin to act in the area of foreign and
                            defense policies. Most important of all&amp;mdash;in terms of <pb n="9"
                                xml:id="d61-09" facs="d61-09"/>implications for the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>&amp;mdash;there is an irregular drift
                            westwards, reflecting popular preferences, the inability of federal
                            authorities to arrest such a drift, and the increasing decentralization
                            of the economy.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, the Soviets would be likely to shift their
                            policies away from cordiality and assistance&amp;mdash;on the grounds
                            that a faltering regime in Belgrade would be unable to respond
                            appropriately even if it were inclined to do so&amp;mdash;and back
                            toward a much more austere, if not openly unfriendly, relationship.
                            Efforts would be made at the same time to meddle in and to exploit
                            Yugoslavia's internal difficulties, to cultivate elements in the
                            republics and dissidents of one stripe or another, to intensify gray and
                            black propaganda, and to stir up Yugoslavia's lingering territorial,
                            ideological, and political differences with Western countries. It could
                            be that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would find itself
                            gradually drawn into more and more direct involvement in the affairs of
                            a part or all of the weakening or disintegrating federation.</p>
                        <p>Contingency B: A disintegrated Yugoslavia. In this case, it is supposed
                            that some or all of the republics in effect secede. Some (e.g., Croatia)
                            turn to the West for help; others remain non-aligned. Remnants of the
                            federal government and the majority of high military officers hope to
                            restore the federation, by force if necessary, and are backed by some
                            republican governments (e.g., Serbia). Civil war threatens, and the
                            Western-oriented republics appeal for aid from the <gloss

                            and political support by, say, the Serbs.</p>
                        <p>Reactions in Moscow to such a situation would be mixed and the subject of
                            serious debate. Some leaders would argue that the situation offered the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> a golden opportunity to
                            reassert its control over much of Yugoslavia and that a failure to act
                            would be tantamount to handling at least a part of the country over to
                            the imperialists. Others, however, would be apprehensive about the
                            possible eventual involvement of the Soviet Army in a Balkan civil war,
                            would want to carefully weigh the risk of a confrontation with the West,
                            and would advocate talks with the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and
                            other Western countries. Especially in view of recent agreements with
                            the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, the majority of the Soviet
                            leadership would probably favor caution and a policy designed
                            essentially to quarantine the trouble, at least for a time. But the
                            leadership's ultimate decision would rest in large part on (a) the
                            then-prevailing climate of relations between East and West in Europe;
                            (b) the Soviet estimate of likely political and military reactions in
                            the West; and (c) the state of unrest, if any, in Eastern Europe. And a
                            decision to intervene would be most likely if (a) Soviet policies of
                            detente had already been attenuated; (b) the West did not appear ready
                            to respond forcefully; and (c) it looked as if the Yugoslav disruptions
                            might unsettle matters elsewhere in Eastern Europe.</p>

                            almost an article of faith in the West that the balance in Europe would
                            be significantly altered if Belgrade were to readhere to the Soviet
                            Bloc. It is recognized in Moscow that for this reason, among others,
                            direct Soviet intervention in Yugoslavia would be viewed in the West as
                            a matter of grave concern. 7</p>
                        <p>7) <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> has in effect so warned. The
                            Communique of the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Ministerial
                            Meeting of November 1968 (following the Soviet invasion of
                            Czechoslovakia) urged the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to
                            “refrain from using force and interfering in the affairs of other
                            states,” asserted that <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members
                            could not remain indifferent to “any development which endangers their
                            security,” and warned that “any Soviet intervention directly or
                            indirectly affecting the situation in Europe or in the Mediterranean
                            would create an international crisis with grave consequences.” It was
                            clear at the time that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and others
                            were addressing the problem of “gray” areas in Europe, and that they
                            were concerned about the future security of Yugoslavia, among
                            others.</p>
                        <p>23. It is generally agreed that while not ideal, Belgrade's position and
                            policies are advantageous to Western interests. And most West European
                            states would regard a threatened Soviet invasion of Yugoslavia as having
                            important implications for their own security. They would not view an
                            actual invasion, as they did the Soviet move into Czechoslovakia, as an
                            unfortunate but essentially defensive move by Moscow to protect existing
                            interests within the Bloc; on the contrary, they would see in it an
                            unnecessary and provocative offensive move into non-Bloc territory,
                            designed in the main to expand Soviet power rather than preserve it. And
                            it would signal for most Westerners the end of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>'s policies of detente in Europe as a
                            whole. None of this, however, would be likely to persuade the European
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members that an effective
                            response could be made to the Soviet threat without full participation
                            by the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. They thus would be inclined,
                            among other things, to see in the Soviet threat a test of the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> commitment to European security.</p>
                        <p>24. In order to forestall a threatened Soviet invasion, <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> (or the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and individual members of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, if there were no decisions by the alliance as such),
                            would have to issue serious warnings and be prepared to back them up. It
                            could, for example, make clear that it would provide direct military
                            support to Yugoslavia in the event of Soviet military intervention, and
                            it could begin to implement moves to carry this out. If, in this manner,
                            the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and the major West European states
                            together declared their vital concern for the integrity and independence
                            of Yugoslavia, the Soviets would probably conclude that there was little
                            that they could accomplish in Yugoslavia which would be commensurate
                            with the risk.</p>

                        <p>SUMMARY: <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy toward Yugoslavia
                            should continue to be one of supporting Yugoslav independence, unity,
                            stability and economic viability. This support will be particularly
                            important to the new Yugoslav leadership in the period following
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s departure from the
                            leadership arena. A necessary corollary of this support will be
                            continued and even intensified demonstrations of our confidence in the
                            leadership's ability to direct the course of Yugoslavia's internal and
                            foreign affairs despite continuing problems of federalism, nationalism
                            and economic development. Expressions of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> confidence will be particularly valuable here as
                            antidotes to the inevitable rumors and press accounts about Yugoslavia's
                            crisis -- possibly even splitting apart -- after <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> goes or about its “moving to the
                            East”.</p>
                        <p>Despite press speculation, there has been no impairment of Yugoslav
                            independence, sovereignty and nonalignment. In fact, there has been a
                            strengthening of the fabric of all-Yugoslav unity since <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d62-02" facs="d62-02"/>regional nationalism almost got out
                            of hand a year and a half ago. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia
                                (<gloss target="#t_LCY1">LCY</gloss>), backed up by the power of the
                            Army, has moved to reassert its authority over activities at all levels
                            of Yugoslav political life. The occasional anti-Western fall-out of the
                                <gloss target="#t_LCY1">LCY</gloss>'s tightening-up process should
                            not distract our attention from whatever real accomplishments the
                            Yugoslav government and Party have made and will make in enhancing
                            all-Yugoslav strength and cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The wide regional disparities in economic development constitute the most
                            serious continuing potential threat to Yugoslav cohesion. Even with
                            decentralization of the economy and the demands of the economic
                            stabilization program, the government continues to channel resources to
                            the least-developed areas of the country. The need for capital and
                            technology from abroad will require, as in the past, an active policy on
                            the part of the Yugoslavs to increase this country's bilateral economic
                            contacts and seek more advantageous relations with the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CEMA1"
                            >CEMA</gloss>. The Yugoslavs will play a greater role in the future
                            among the developing countries; in upcoming negotiations we expect them
                            to seek preferential treatment for the developing countries in all
                            areas, including <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> link,
                            non-reciprocity on tariffs and equal treatment of all less-developed
                            countries in the markets of developed countries. It would serve <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy to work closely with the Yugoslavs
                            in multilateral trade negotiations and to take joint or parallel
                            initiatives on specific trade issues that serve our mutual interests.
                            Increased US economic activity in the least-developed areas of
                            Yugoslavia and particularly in the field of agriculture will help
                            support our goal of a more viable Yugoslav federation.</p>
                        <p>Our contacts in the economic and other fields will further improve with
                            the realization of high-level visits now only in the planning stage. An
                            early visit to Yugoslavia by the secretary of Defense would speed the
                            normalization of relations between military/defense staffs of the two
                            countries. The most important visit now planned from the Yugoslav side
                            is that of Premier BIJEDIC, hopefully to take place in 1974. END
                            SUMMARY.</p>
                        <p>BACKGROUND: In an effort to reconstitute itself as a cohesive force in
                            the political sphere, the Party has in the past year increased its
                            control over activities at all levels of Yugoslav political life. This
                            tightening-up process had been signaled at the Second <gloss
                                target="#t_LCY1">LCY</gloss> Conference a year and a half ago and
                            was emphatically demanded in last autumn's letter from Tito and the
                            Party Executive Bureau to all Party members. “The Letter” has served as
                            the touchstone for <pb n="3" xml:id="d62-03" facs="d62-03"/>subsequent
                                <gloss target="#t_LC1">LC</gloss> activity and intervention in broad
                            areas of the Yugoslav society. Increased Party control and discipline
                            has done away with anything that remained of decentralization in
                            Republic/Province Party organizations after nationalistic outbreaks got
                            beyond the control of the local Party leaders in Croatia late in 1971.
                            Some capable Republic and Province leaders have been ousted in the
                            process, but to date there has been nothing to resemble the extensive
                            Party/government removals which took place in Croatia starting in
                            December 19 71 after <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s
                            intervention.</p>
                        <p>Tightening-up in the Party has been reflected in certain other sectors.
                            Internal security organs have been given increased powers in connection
                            with prosecution as well as the most favorable publicity they have
                            enjoyed since the fall of RANKOVIC (1966). This is partly as a reaction
                            to the armed incursion of a band of 19 Croatian terrorists from abroad
                            last summer, partly to give the police more authority to deal with
                            increasing crime and economic corruption, and partly to strengthen the
                            Party's hand in its move to restore its authority. There are as yet
                            unconfirmed reports of the removal of Presidential Security Advisor
                            Miskovic, one of those who called loudest for vigilance against Western
                            influences threatening Yugoslav security. If true, this could signify
                            some relaxation -- although not abandonment -- of the “vigilance”
                            campaign.</p>
                        <p>Some professors, particularly in the Philosophical Faculty at Belgrade
                            University have been threatened with expulsion from the Party because of
                            “liberalism” or too close ties to the West; the relevant party
                            organizations are in the process of dealing with demands for expulsion
                            from higher up. The Party has simultaneously clamped down on some media
                            reporting and programming; the press, radio and television are generally
                            avoiding controversies, putting greater emphasis on worker and Party
                            “news” and down-playing somewhat material from the West; media attacks
                            against the West, although still only intermittent, have increased in
                            the past year. Some Yugoslavs have shown inhibitions in their contacts
                            with official US programs in the educational, cultural and information
                            fields, such as the International Visitors Program, but there has been
                            no broad damage to these contacts to date. Rumors about repression in
                            Yugoslavia and a return to authoritarianism are exaggerated and
                            misleading and have simply provided material for more anti-Western press
                            stories here.</p>
                        <p>The single most important factor is still <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> himself -- chief of state, head of the Party, and
                            commander-in-chief of the armed forces. We believe from direct evidence
                            that stories about his being in poor health or becoming senile are not
                            true. While he may tire more quickly with advancing age, at 81 <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> remains active, alert and in

                        <p>DOLANC, recently re-elected Secretary of the <gloss target="#t_LCY1"
                                >LCY</gloss> Executive Bureau, is by no means the clear heir
                            apparent even to <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s Party
                            position, although he is obviously in the best position at this time to
                            move into the top <gloss target="#t_LCY1">LCY</gloss> spot when
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> leaves it. (While
                            long-time Tito aide and chief Party ideologue KARDELJ is also spoken of
                            here as a long-shot candidate to succeed <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> in the Party, he seems to us to be somewhat removed
                            from the center of Party power and activity.)</p>
                        <p>In fact, there has been no move to prepare Yugoslavs for an individual
                            successor to all of <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s
                            powers. On the contrary, the collective Presidency, which has been in
                            office only two years, is being trimmed down in size under the
                            provisions of the draft Yugoslav constitution in an attempt to increase
                            its effectiveness for the day when it will be called on to act on its
                            own initiative and not as Tito's surrogate. The head of the Party will
                            also be a member of the Presidency under this reorganization plan.</p>
                        <p>The army (<gloss target="#t_JNA1">JNA</gloss>) remains the other
                            principal source of power for Yugoslavia unity, backing up the cohesive
                            political force of the Party. There is a meeting of minds between the
                                <gloss target="#t_JNA1">JNA</gloss> and the Party since both stand
                            for the perpetuation of the tradition of military professionalism and
                            national preparedness, and it seems unlikely there will be any change in
                            this picture. The <gloss target="#t_JNA1">JNA</gloss> has apparently
                            been careful not to assume openly any policy-making role, presumably
                            preferring to rely on interest-groups within the Party to serve its
                            political and professional ends.</p>
                        <p>On foreign policy Yugoslavia has been increasingly running with the
                            radical pack in the nonaligned movement to maintain its position of
                            leadership in the movement. It is pulling out all stops as it seeks
                            converts to the cause and brings world attention to bear on the Algiers
                            Nonaligned Summit this September. Yugoslavia portrays itself as the
                            leader of the struggle of the developing have-nots against the greedy
                            developed countries. The West in general has at times come under fire
                            from Yugoslav leadership, a situation explicable in part as a reaction
                            to stretched stories in the Western press about Yugoslavia's
                            disintegrating, in part as an inevitable by-product of the sharp
                            re-emphasis of “self-management socialist” ideology and of the Party's
                            attempts to enforce discipline from the center, and in part as an
                            externalization of the complicated internal pressures on the regime. The
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in particular is seen as a
                            relatively safe target. For example, <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> in an interview in February said in effect that
                            Uncle Sam would put up with having his nose tweaked by the Yugoslavs and
                            not “make an issue” of it. In fact, <pb n="5" xml:id="d62-05"
                                facs="d62-05"/>
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> patience with the Yugoslavs wore thin
                            shortly thereafter because of their anti-<gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> activities before and during the Security Council
                            meeting in Panama, and we told them so. Despite this and other
                            irritants, our bilateral relations have in general remained (in Tito's
                            own evaluation) very good, indicated in part by continuing strong <gloss
                                target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> interest in top-level visit exchanges,
                            in the broadening of our economic cooperation, and in developing contact
                            in the military sphere. Yugoslav relations with the Soviets have also
                            been good since BREZHNEV visited here in 1971. But Yugoslavia has in no
                            way compromised its independence or lowered its guard; it has continued
                            to deny the Soviets the use of its territory and military facilities
                            strictly limiting the frequency of Soviet military visits and confining
                            Soviet aircraft and ships to the use of commercial facilities. The
                            leadership was highly sensitive to charges of Yugoslavia's having “moved
                            to the East”. In his most recent significant foreign policy statement
                            (his message to the Assembly of the Federation in April) <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> took care to stress his country's
                            firm nonalignment rather than brotherly socialist ties with the Warsaw
                            Pact states.</p>
                        <p>The Yugoslavs have continued to show progress in the economic sphere. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> is growing by about six percent
                            a year, and industrial production by seven percent. However, activity
                            has slowed recently because of a drop in total demand, shortage of raw
                            materials, high cost of imports, illiquidity in some enterprises and
                            under-utilization of plant capacity. Agricultural production remains at
                            a relatively low level, partly because the government has not given
                            sufficient assistance to private farmers (who account for 70 percent of
                            the total agricultural production); shortages of agricultural
                            commodities have pushed up price levels. The balance of payments showed
                            a $295 million current account surplus in 1972; foreign exchange
                            reserves are now over a billion dollars.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the major improvements in balance of payments, priority
                            attention is being directed toward potentially destabilizing social and
                            economic factors. Inflation is the principal domestic economic problem;
                            the cost of living is up nearly 20 percent from a year ago. Despite a
                            battery of stabilization measures aimed at curtailing demand,
                            inflationary pressures remain strong because of supply bottlenecks and
                            increased dinar costs for imports, resulting partly from devaluation.
                            Inflation has aggravated the problem of personal income disparities and
                            has spurred reform of the tax structure. The overall unemployment rate
                            is 7.5%; in the least developed areas of Yugoslavia the unemployment
                            rate is not only very high (about 20%) but increasing. Yugoslavia needs
                            at least 130, 000 new jobs annually, taking into account labor out-flow
                            from rural areas to urban centers and the natural growth in the labor
                            force. The non-agricultural sector cannot absorb this labor increase at
                            current levels of investment activity. Emigration <pb n="6"
                                xml:id="d62-06" facs="d62-06"/>has therefore remained a significant
                            factor in absorbing surplus labor, although the government would like to
                            work out measures to keep its skilled laborers from leaving Yugoslavia.
                            Wide regional income disparities constitute a potential threat to
                            all-Yugoslav cohesion, and the government has continued, even with
                            decentralization of the economy, to channel resources to the
                            least-developed areas of the country. Structural changes such as the
                            shift of population from rural to urban areas are being handled in an
                            orderly way, but the total spectrum of economic and social pressures
                            operating on the political system remains substantial.</p>
                        <p>The need for capital and technology from abroad for internal development
                            has remained a principal determinant of Yugoslav foreign economic
                            policy. The Federal Executive Council has gone on record in support of
                            expanded, long-term economic ties with the US. There is considerable
                            concern here over the enlarged area of commercial discrimination against
                            Yugoslavia resulting from the EC enlargement and the continued
                            proliferation of preferential trading arrangements, as well as over the
                            decline in Yugoslav trade with other developing countries. The Yugoslavs
                            have recently signed a new non-preferential five-year trade agreement
                            with the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>. The Yugoslavs have taken an
                            increasingly active role as an observer in <gloss target="#t_CEMA1"
                                >CEMA</gloss>. They received a $540 million Soviet clearing credit
                            in November 1972; there has been no draw-down of this credit, although
                            three project agreements have been negotiated involving a total
                            investment of $40 million.</p>
                        <p>PROSPECTS: The Yugoslav leadership appears to have made a good start
                            toward installing political machinery and personnel to handle the
                            stresses and strains of the immediate post-Tito period. The policy under
                            Titoism of rotating officials and shifting them frequently between Party
                            and government assignments -- with the “nationality key” now playing a
                            more important role in choosing people than do credentials as an Old
                            Fighter -- has produced a pool of fairly impressive leadership talent at
                            the higher levels. The longer the collective leadership is able to
                            continue to function with its legitimacy fully attested by Tito, the
                            better its prospects for handling the succession period.</p>
                        <p>In the longer run, there is no reason to expect that truly collective
                            leadership will prove to be more enduring in Yugoslavia than it has
                            elsewhere. Clearly one man, the head of the Party, will have the best
                            organizational springboard to power. The JNA, to the extent that it can
                            be distinguished from the Party as a political force, can be counted on
                            to support whoever appears most devoted to the cause of Yugoslav unity,
                            best able to hold the country together in times of crisis, and best
                            disposed to preserve and enhance the strength and the balance <pb n="7"
                                xml:id="d62-07" facs="d62-07"/>of the armed forces. For as long as
                            political-economic policy supports the <gloss target="#t_JNA1"
                                >JNA</gloss> as a viable instrument of defense, there is little
                            prospect of Bonapartism in Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>We look for the Party to maintain effective control of political and
                            social processes. The Yugoslav leadership plans to make the Tenth <gloss

                            delegates to be injected into the assembly system at all levels and will
                            presumably allow the Party, in the name of self-management, to have more
                            direct control over the work of the entire Yugoslav political
                            process.</p>
                        <p>Various tensions will continue to exist because of basic contradictions;
                            attempts to make the <gloss target="#t_LCY1">LCY</gloss> as much and as
                            meaningful a part of Yugoslav society as the Party was during Partisan
                            days will encounter apathy, cynicism and even open disaffection
                            (particularly on the part of the youth); exhortations of “socialist
                            morality” will have to contend with rising consumerism, the modern youth
                            culture, and other attractions; appeals to support all-Yugoslav
                            undertakings will find opposition, if less blatant than in the past,
                            from supporters of nationality causes. Good relations among the
                            nationalities and the machinery required to speed up coordination among
                            the Republics and Provinces, particularly of economic undertakings, will
                            be crucial for Yugoslav development over the next years.</p>
                        <p>Economic policy will be basic to the maintenance of national unity and
                            security in the future. The thrust of <gloss target="#t_GOY1"
                                >GOY</gloss> policy will be directed at strengthening the workers
                            self-management system based on free market principles; vigorous
                            implementation of stabilization measures to counteract inflation;
                            expansion of agricultural production; restructuring of industrial
                            investment to improve efficiency; and channeling of more resources to
                            the least-developed areas in an effort to reduce regional income
                            disparities. We expect the Yugoslavs to place more emphasis in the
                            future on improving the basic ingredients of long-term growth, such as
                            more innovation, better use of skilled manpower, and new measures for
                            mobilizing and channeling capital into productive enterprises, including
                            agriculture. We expect real growth in <gloss target="#t_GNP1"
                                >GNP</gloss> to continue at a rate of about six percent, but price
                            increases will probably not be held below ten percent for 1973. A
                            balance of payments surplus is expected in 1973 and the dinar has
                            actually appreciated vis-a-vis some hard currencies.</p>
                        <p>Efforts will continue to integrate the Yugoslav economy into the world
                            economy and to develop closer trade and financial relations with the
                            convertible currency countries especially. In addition to closer ties to
                            the <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss>, the Yugoslavs will <pb n="8"
                                xml:id="d62-08" facs="d62-08"/>seek more advantageous relations with
                                <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> in future, while remaining in
                            an observer status. We expect the Yugoslavs to play an even greater role
                            among the economically developing countries during the forthcoming
                            negotiations on multilateral trade and international monetary reform as
                            a reflection of their deep concern about the development gap and the
                            “crisis of confidence” between the developed and the developing
                            countries. In these negotiations we expect the Yugoslavs to seek
                            preferential treatment for the developing countries in all areas,
                            including <gloss target="#t_SDR1">SDR</gloss> link, non-reciprocity on
                            tariffs and equal treatment of all <gloss target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s
                            in the markets of developed countries. In view of their basic opposition
                            to preferential trade arrangements between developed and developing
                            countries, on both economic and political grounds, the Yugoslavs will
                            probably be prepared to take some initiatives that would be mutually
                            beneficial to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Yugoslav trade, such as
                            phasing out <gloss target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> reversed preferences and
                            the incorporation of special preferences into generalized preference
                            schemes.</p>
                        <p>The Yugoslavs are not satisfied with the present <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> share in their total trade (about six percent) and can
                            be expected to encourage closer economic cooperation with the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, including increased private capital
                            inflow for joint venture investments, floating of securities on the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> capital market, formation of a
                            joint <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Yugoslav chamber of commerce and
                            other measures to expand business contacts. Continued Western support,
                            including trade measures to expand foreign exchange availabilities for
                            the import of capital and technology, will remain fundamental to the
                            strengthening of Yugoslav economic viability and independence.</p>
                        <p>Yugoslavia can be counted on to insure its future independence by
                            maintaining a strong military, geared mainly to guerilla warfare against
                            a potential occupier, the Soviet Union. The leadership is unlikely to
                            abandon nonalignment in the foreseeable future, since a policy of
                            nonalignment has given Yugoslavia a world platform to emphasize and get
                            Third World support for its independence and to criticize “bloc”
                            policies, including preferential trade arrangements. At times Yugoslav
                            expressions of nonalignment will appear to cross the boundary into
                            anti-Americanism; but it is also likely that conflicts of interest with
                            the Soviets will develop from time to time, particularly as the Soviets
                            concentrate more on their relations with the developed West and Japan to
                            help satisfy their need for technology and capital than on relations
                            with the underdeveloped and nonaligned states. Past experience indicates
                            that the extension of credits to Yugoslavia from East or West in
                            whatever amounts will not compromise the basic Yugoslav desire to
                            maintain full independence.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> POLICY TOWARD YUGOSLAVIA: THE
                            CHALLENGE AND THE GOAL: The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> will be
                            challenged frequently in its relations with Yugoslavia in the years
                            ahead. Nonalignment will inevitably bring Yugoslavia to take attitudes
                            of confrontation toward the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>,
                            particularly as it supports Arab initiatives or makes special appeals to
                            Latin American states to join the ranks of the nonaligned. It will be
                            necessary to keep in mind the overriding value of Yugoslav independence
                            when Yugoslav “non-alignment” is expressed in multilateral forums in
                            ways which run counter to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> policy aims
                            and programs elsewhere in the world.</p>
                        <p>We must keep our lines of communication with the Yugoslavs open at all
                            times and let them know what our interests, plans and priorities are
                            (and hopefully discover what theirs are). In many cases we will not in
                            fact be able to deter unwelcome actions on the part of the Yugoslavs. It
                            will, even in such cases, be necessary for us to distinguish carefully
                            between the instances when the Yugoslavs are merely being “difficult” as
                            we see it and those when they are going beyond the bounds of
                            acceptability. We should avoid permanent damage to <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Yugoslav relations by not allowing
                            essentially minor events to escalate into a round of formal demarches,
                            charges and counter-charges.</p>
                        <p>Our goal will remain that of supporting Yugoslav independence, unity,
                            stability and economic viability. This goal will not change in the
                            post-Tito years or in the instances when the Yugoslavs appear to be
                            supporting an anti-American line. It is important that the Yugoslavs be
                            kept aware that this is the basic goal of <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> policy toward their country. This will require keeping
                            the dialogue going during the bad times as well as the good.</p>
                        <p>The more confidence there is among the Yugoslavs that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government understands their problems,
                            knows what the realities and dynamics of Yugoslav internal and foreign
                            policies are, and sympathizes with those measures aimed at strengthening
                            Yugoslav unity, the better chance there will be for our relations to
                            weather the inevitable storms without lasting damage. The continuation
                            of the exchange of high-level visitors is essential in this regard. We
                            particularly hope for a visit to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            by Premier Bijedic early in 1974. An early visit to Yugoslavia by the
                            Secretary of Defense would give valuable support to the program being
                            encouraged by both sides of working out more extensive contacts between
                            the military/defense staffs of the two countries. Statements by American
                            officials underlining our continuing interest in this country's
                            integrity, independence and genuine nonalignment have an importance here
                            which must never be underestimated. It is imperative that <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> visits and official statements by
                            visitors treat Yugoslavia not as just one of the several Eastern
                            European countries but as the special case it is: communist but not
                            allied with the Warsaw Pact states.</p>

                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> economic support is crucial to assure
                            continuing sound economic growth in Yugoslavia and thereby ease
                            sectional tensions which could threaten future stability and cohesion.
                            We should take steps to further improve the good existing relations with
                            Yugoslavia in the economic, trade, finance and science and technological
                            fields. These relations will develop faster with greater contact. From
                            our side we should encourage early visits by Secretaries <persName
                                corresp="#p_SGP1">Shultz</persName>, Dent and Butz, all of whom have
                            been invited by the Yugoslavs; vigorously support the idea of a joint
                            chamber of commerce or mixed committee of businessmen to exchange views;
                            and increase trade mission activity and <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                >USG</gloss> participation in trade fairs in Yugoslavia. The
                            encouragement of capital investment for joint ventures should receive
                            even greater support from the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> than in
                            the past. We should provide appropriate assistance to the Yugoslavs in
                            their efforts to float securities in the US capital markets in order to
                            increase foreign exchange availabilities for the import of capital and
                            technology. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support may take the form
                            of statements to keep developments in Yugoslavia in proper perspective
                            and of helping in other ways to insure the dissemination of accurate
                            information on this country. We should continue to offer <gloss
                                target="#t_CCC1">CCC</gloss> commodity credits, which have been
                            helpful in countering inflation. The policy of supporting an integral
                            and viable federation will be enhanced by greater <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> economic activity in the least-developed areas of
                            Yugoslavia and particularly in the field of agriculture. Export-Import
                            Bank and World Bank credits will play an important role in this regard.
                            In particular, we should be as forthcoming as possible on the Yugoslav
                            request for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> financing of high-protein
                            feeds and of breeding cattle. The cooperative scientific and
                            technological research program is an important factor in our bilateral
                            relations; every effort should be made to find additional resources for
                            deposit in the recently-established joint fund on a matching basis.
                            Commerce should explore the possibilities for assisting the Yugoslav
                            tourist industry.</p>
                        <p>We should work closely with the Yugoslavs during the forthcoming
                            multilateral trade negotiations and be prepared to take joint or
                            parallel initiatives on specific trade issues that serve mutual
                            interests. Serious consideration should be given to a high-level <gloss

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government should respond favorably

                            face of new inhibitions and fresh sources of friction which may arise,
                            we should be flexible in the administration of our various exchange
                            programs. Hopefully we can increase the numbers of travelers by a
                            persistent and imaginative quest for new and mutually beneficial areas
                            of exchange and avoid any decrease in such travel.</p>
                        <p>Increased cooperation with the Yugoslavs in dealing with international
                            terrorism in all forms will at times require great patience on our part.
                            The Yugoslav role to date has been disappointing despite the Yugoslav's
                            own concern over emigre terrorism. We should make clear that we
                            understand the critical threat which emigre terrorist activity
                            represents for their country, while seeking to achieve the Yugoslavs'
                            commitment to work also for measures aimed at other kinds of terrorism
                            affecting them less directly.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> in its policies and official
                            statements should give proof of the confidence we have maintained
                            throughout the twenty-five years of overall Yugoslav progress since
                            Tito's expulsion from the Cominform that this country will meet crises
                            successfully despite continuing problems of federalism, nationalism and
                            economic development. Our stake in the success of the Yugoslav
                            experiment is as great now as it was when we first committed ourselves
                            to assist <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s Yugoslavia to
                            retain its independence. The critical period after Tito's departure from
                            the scene will require us to reiterate and demonstrate in practice our
                            confidence in Yugoslavia's future.</p>

                        <p>October 19, 1973</p>
                        <p>Participants: <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Jaksa Petric</persName>, Deputy
                            Federal Secretary</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Fejic</persName> (phonetic) Assistant to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM9">Malcolm Toon</persName>
                        </p>
                        <p>At my request I called on Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJ3"
                                >Petric</persName> today at 0900. Our meeting lasted 45 minutes.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> that the purpose of
                            my call was to follow up Assistant Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>'s meeting with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_GT2">Granfil</persName> last week in which
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> had cited a number
                            of recent developments which he felt cast a shadow over our bilateral
                            relations. Since I assumed that Petric had received a full report of
                                <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>'s demarche from
                                <persName corresp="#p_GT2">Granfil</persName>, I would try not to
                            replow the same ground. I did however wish to make a few points in order
                            to put into perspective the current state of our relations as I viewed
                            them.</p>
                        <p>At the outset I felt it was important for <persName corresp="#p_PJ3"
                                >Petric</persName> to know that we understood and respected
                            Yugoslavia's policy of nonalignment just as we hoped Yugoslav officials
                            would understand and respect United States positions on various foreign
                            policy issues even if they might not agree with them. As a friend of
                            Yugoslavia however I did hope that henceforth in their implementation of
                            their policy of nonalignment, the Yugoslavs would make an assiduous
                            effort to avoid doing or saying things which would only give rise to
                            friction and misunderstanding between our two countries. Without wishing
                            to appear paternalistic, I would suggest to <persName corresp="#p_PJ3"
                                >Petric</persName> that Yugoslavia should exercise caution in three
                            principal areas. First, I would hope that Yugoslavia would more closely
                            consider United States vital interests before taking actions impinging
                            adversely upon them; I had in mind for example the Yugoslav role in the
                            Panama Security Council meeting and its sponsorship of various
                            resolutions on Puerto Rico. As <persName corresp="#p_PJ3"
                                >Petric</persName> knew, I had spoken at length with Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName> on our concern with
                            regard to these two subjects, and I saw no need to go into further
                            detail now. Secondly, I would counsel the Yugoslavs in the future to
                            avoid innuendoes and insinuations concerning United States behavior
                            which they knew, to be without any foundation; I had in mind recent
                            statements both in the press and elsewhere concerning our alleged role
                            in the overturn of the Allende Government in Chile. Finally, I would
                            hope that Yugoslavia <pb n="2" xml:id="d66-02" facs="d66-02"/>would
                            refrain from statements and actions which could only exacerbate
                            situations already fraught with danger and raise international tensions
                            generally; here I had in mind particularly Yugoslav behavior with regard
                            to the current Middle East crisis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> interjected at this point
                            to ask what statements I had in mind in my reference to Yugoslav
                            allegations concerning our role in Chile. I said that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>'s statement in the General
                            Assembly, while cast in general terms, was capable of being interpreted
                            and was being so interpreted in many quarters as a charge that we had a
                            principal responsibility for the overthrow of Allende. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> demurred, saying that we should
                            not be so sensitive as to think that every time “imperialist circles”
                            are mentioned the speaker has the United States in mind. He went on to
                            say that of course there had been Yugoslav press allegations concerning
                            United States behavior and there had been statements by “politicians” on
                            the same theme, but we should not regard these as expressions of
                            official opinion. I asked <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName>
                            if he would regard Mr. Bilic (Executive. Bureau, <gloss target="#t_LCY1"
                                >LCY</gloss>) who had made some particularly malicious and totally
                            unfounded allegations concerning my country in the recent issue of
                            Kommunist as simply a “politician”. Petric seemed somewhat taken aback
                            and muttered that Bilic was a “politician of sorts”.</p>
                        <p>I then said that I thought it would be useful for <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> and for his Government's
                            understanding of our position of the Middle East crisis if I explained
                            in some detail the actions which my Government had taken since the onset
                            of the crisis and were continuing to take in an effort to calm a
                            situation which represented a serious danger for world peace. From the
                            very beginning we had sought to stop the fighting and to lay the
                            groundwork for a settlement fair and just for all parties concerned.
                            Toward this end we had convened a meeting of the Security Council and,
                            more importantly, we had begun serious and urgent discussions in
                            diplomatic channels with a number of powers, including the Soviet Union.
                            Beyond this we had from the beginning exercised great restraint in our
                            arms policy toward Israel's arsenal. Unfortunately, our efforts had not
                            been successful and in all frankness I must tell <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> that a major factor in our lack
                            of success was the failure of the Soviet Union to cooperate with us. As
                            Petric was aware, not only had the Soviet Union declined to cooperate
                            with us in restricting the supply of arms to the area but it had
                            launched a massive airlift of materiel for the Arab States which by now
                            exceeded 400 flights and some 8,000 tons of military equipment. We had
                            been not only disappointed in Soviet behavior but also disturbed by the
                            haste with which Yugoslavia had facilitated this massive airlift by
                            according what seemed to be unlimited overflight privileges to the
                            Soviet <pb n="3" xml:id="d66-03" facs="d66-03"/>Union and, according to
                            some reports, other facilities. In a word, we did not think that
                            Yugoslav behavior - as well as its statements -had been helpful in
                            taking the heat out of the situation in the Middle East. Despite our
                            discouragement with the apparent lack of success of our efforts so far,
                            we were continuing our discussions with the Soviet Union and other
                            powers in bilateral channels in order to bring an end to hostilities. We
                            hoped that Yugoslavia would do everything in its power to bring about
                            this end.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> said that by asking for an
                            appointment to see him I had in a certain sense stolen his thunder since
                            he had intended to call me in and express his Government's concern and
                            unhappiness at the Stoessel demarche. There were a number of things
                            about <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>'s meeting with
                                <persName corresp="#p_GT2">Granfil</persName> which puzzled and
                            disturbed the Yugoslavs. First, they were concerned at the link drawn
                            between Yugoslavia's implementation of its nonaligned policy and
                            bilateral relations. Yugoslavia had always felt that political
                            differences existed and would continue to exist between our two
                            countries, that it had been our joint determination to discuss them
                            frankly, but that it had been our practice not to let these differences
                            interfere with the development of our bilateral relations. Such
                            relations, Petric said should be viewed according to the criteria set
                            forth in the joint declaration signed by our two Presidents in
                            Washington in the fall of 1971. It was Yugoslavia's intention to
                            continue to adhere to the terms of this Declaration and <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> hoped that we too regarded the
                            Declaration as valid - although in all frankness, Yugoslav confidence in
                            this had been somewhat shaken by <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1"
                                >Stoessel</persName>'s demarche. Secondly, the Yugoslavs had been
                            annoyed at Stoessel's references to “anti-Americanism” in Yugoslavia's
                            current posture and attitudes. <persName corresp="#p_PJ3"
                                >Petric</persName> could assure me that no Yugoslav policy or action
                            could be characterized objectively as anti-American; Yugoslav policies
                            and actions were cast and implemented in terms of Yugoslavia's national
                            interests which admittedly on occasion might not coincide with United
                            States national interests. Finally, <persName corresp="#p_PJ3"
                                >Petric</persName> and his colleagues had been disturbed at Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s failure to
                            receive Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName> during his stay
                            in the United States and were particularly dismayed by Stoessel's
                            observation that “the time was not appropriate for such a meeting”.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> pointed out that even
                            in the darkest days of our relationship when Mr. Dulles was a key figure
                            in Washington, it had always been possible for a Yugoslav Foreign
                            Minister to meet with the American Secretary of State. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName> in New York had carried on
                            fruitful conversations with some 45 foreign ministers - including all of
                            the major powers except, regrettably, the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d66-04" facs="d66-04"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> then said he and his
                            colleagues were astounded at Stoessel's reference to “base facilities”
                            accorded by the Yugoslavs to the Soviet Union. The United States should
                            know that Yugoslavia under Tito had never granted base rights to a
                            foreign power and never would. I said I was glad to have this assurance,
                            but pointed out that it was my understanding that <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> had mentioned “landing
                            facilities” not base rights. Could Petrie give me similar assurances
                            with regard to landing privileges? Petrie ignored my query.</p>
                        <p>In sum - Petrie said - the Yugoslavs at all levels of government were
                            puzzled at the turn of events reflected by <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1"
                                >Stoessel</persName>'s demarche and hoped that this did not signal a
                            deliberate downgrading of the importance of our bilateral relations by
                            the United States side.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> that I felt he and
                            his colleagues had seriously misread the significance of <persName
                                corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName>'s demarche. There certainly
                            was no intention to downgrade the importance of our relations with
                            Yugoslavia; nor was there any deliberate effort to cool our relations.
                            On the other hand, it was important for the Yugoslavs to understand that
                            their actions and statements particularly with regard to areas of vital
                            interest to us are bound to influence the attitudes and hamper the
                            initiatives of our policymakers. It was for this reason that we felt
                            compelled to underline to the Yugoslavs the importance of avoiding
                            actions we considered offensive and insinuations which were totally
                            without foundation. I could assure Petric that while, regrettably, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName> had not been able
                            to see Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>, it continued to
                            be our aim and hope to maintain the frank and open dialogue on foreign
                            policy issues which had characterized our relations in the past.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> then turned to the Middle
                            East, saying that it was important for the United States to understand
                            the preoccupations and motivations of Yugoslavia with regard to the Arab
                            world. Yugoslavia felt strongly that the “Israeli aggressors” should be
                            ousted from the lands which they were illegally occupying and
                            Yugoslavia's Arab friends would receive all “moral, political and
                            material aid” from Yugoslavia toward this end (Petric noted that I would
                            recognize the phrase as that used by the Foreign Office spokesman at his
                            press conference yesterday). Yugoslavia noted with satisfaction that
                            active discussions were being pursued in diplomatic channels and the
                            Yugoslavs hoped that these would be crowned with success. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> noted with some asperity that
                            while the United States and the Soviet Union of course had a major role
                            to play in <pb n="5" xml:id="d66-05" facs="d66-05"/>bringing a just
                            peace to the Middle East, other powers had important stakes in the area
                            as well. He would remind me again of the Yugoslav unhappiness at our
                            failure to begin a dialogue with them because of <persName
                                corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s inability to receive
                            Minic.</p>
                        <p>Yugoslavia's own view was that Sadat's recent speech constituted a sound
                            basis for a fair peace settlement. The speech, <persName
                                corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> felt, was moderate and reasonable
                            - unlike, he said, the subsequent remarks of Golda Meir.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> then said that the Yugoslav
                            Government was seriously concerned by a report which they had received
                            from their Syrian colleagues and which he wished to convey to me
                            privately. The Syrians had recently shot down American aircraft bearing
                            American markings and manned by United States personnel. In the Yugoslav
                            view this was indeed a serious development and if the practice
                            continued, it could only lead to a widening and worsening of the
                            conflict. I should understand that if one side were using foreign
                            nationals in combat, the other side would be obliged to do the same. I
                            should bear in mind that the nonaligned movement was solidly behind the
                            Arab cause and if its members should decide to send volunteers to the
                            Middle East, the conflict could not be contained.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> that there was
                            absolutely no foundation to the allegations made by the Syrians. I could
                            assure him that no American official personnel were involved in combat
                            in the Middle East. I agreed that such a practice would have dangerous
                            consequences, but I felt it was equally dangerous for parties to a
                            conflict to make such irresponsible and unwarranted charges. It was
                            entirely possible that there were United States nationals serving as
                            volunteers in the Israeli Armed Forces although I had no information
                            that this was the case. The important thing for the Yugoslavs to
                            recognize was that there was no American official participation in the
                            hostilities, and I hoped that they would correct the record with their
                            friends. I hoped also that it was not the Yugoslav intention to send
                            volunteers to the Middle East, since such action could only worsen an
                            already dangerous situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> said that there was no
                            present intention to send volunteers to assist their Arab friends, but I
                            should bear in mind the commitment made to the Arab cause at Algiers by
                            members of the nonaligned movement - i.e., to provide all the necessary
                            aid to the Arabs to bring about liberation of the occupied
                            territories.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> then said that he wished to
                            bring to my attention another unpleasant incident affecting our
                            bilateral relations. The Yugoslav General Stiff reported that on
                            September 3 a Pan American Boeing 747 overflew Yugoslav airspace in
                            corridor A-4 (Subotica-Sremska Mitrovica-Belgrade-Topola-Dimitrovgrad)
                            at a height of 10,000 meters, air speed of 900 kilometers with an F-4
                            reconnaissance plane flying the entire route between 300 and 500 meters
                            below the Boeing aircraft. The F-4 was clearly using the Boeing as a
                            shield, <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> observed.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> said Yugoslav anti-aircraft
                            guns followed these aircraft for the entire route but did not react,
                            since this would clearly have been a most dangerous course of action. It
                            is also dangerous, however, for the U.S. to violate Yugoslav airspace,
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> said. He concluded his
                            remarks by stating that the Yugoslav Government had delayed in bringing
                            this incident to the attention of the United States, but since we have
                            begun frank discussion of our relations, including their unpleasant
                            aspects, the time now seemed ripe.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> that naturally I
                            would report this incident to my Government and I was sure that an
                            immediate investigation would be launched. If, in fact, such a violation
                            of Yugoslav airspace had occurred this was indeed regrettable and he
                            would have my apologies.</p>
                        <p>(At one point in the conversation Petric complained about recent articles
                            carried by the Washington Post concerning Yugoslavia. One article which
                            described in some detail Stoessel's demarche to <persName
                                corresp="#p_GT2">Granfil</persName>, in the Yugoslavs' view, must
                            have been based on a careful State Department briefing. Some of his
                            colleagues, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> said, could
                            not avoid the feeling that all articles were inspired by the State
                            Department. This they felt was an unfortunate development since some
                            articles were tendentious and made an unfavorable impression on Yugoslav
                            leaders.)</p>
                        <p>As I left, <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> I expressed the
                            hope that our meeting had served to clarify the atmosphere and also my
                            desire to continue and resume the dialogue on the Middle East and other
                            issues whenever he felt this would be appropriate and desirable.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PJ3">Petric</persName> concurred that our talk
                            had been a useful one and indicated a readiness to discuss our
                            differences at any time.</p>

                                target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> had been working very hard on closer
                            military-to-military cooperation with Yugoslavia for sometime when, last
                            fall, everything fell apart. <gloss target="#t_SECDEF1">SecDef</gloss>
                            told <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> that the signals had changed.
                            All pending actions in the program with Yugoslavia were to be suspended.
                            Later, in January, <gloss target="#t_SECDEF1">SecDef</gloss> became even
                            more chilled toward the Yugoslavs when they gave extensive public
                            exposure to a misrepresentation of remarks <gloss target="#t_SECDEF1"
                                >SecDef</gloss> made in the course of a TV interview. Amb. Toon
                            replied that <gloss target="#t_SECDEF1">SecDef</gloss>'s reaction was
                            understandable. Yugoslav behavior had been abominable. However, there
                            appear to have been some results from plain talking in Belgrade. The
                            Yugoslavs may have learned to move with more caution in the areas of
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> vital interests.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> said that the Yugoslavs
                            have a peculiar notion that they can compartmentalize different aspects
                            of their relations with the same country. If they do not like what a
                            country is doing they believe that they can say so, while on the other
                            hand believing that they are continuing to improve relations with that
                            country. Amb <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> said that he <pb

                            that policy is made by people and that people get offended. He believed
                            that the message had gotten across to the Yugoslavs. In the last six
                            weeks particularly, Amb. <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName>
                            thought there was evidence of a change in the Yugoslav handling of
                            issues involving the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>. Furthermore, in
                            the Yugoslav view the Ambassador thought that the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> had begun to appear less pro-Israel. Therefore he was
                            confident that time would help to cool the rhetoric. Amb. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> thought that <gloss
                                target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PVARE1">Peet</persName> might be able to get word
                            through (to <gloss target="#t_SECDEF1">SecDef</gloss>) about the change.
                            As a result, perhaps <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Yugoslav
                            relations could get back on track. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_TM9"
                                >TOON</persName> emphasized his opinion that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would not be doing the Yugoslavs a favor.
                            Rather the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would be pursuing its own

                            <persName corresp="#p_PVARE1">Peet</persName> responded that he was
                            confident that the <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> policy regarding
                            Yugoslavia was well coordinated with senior levels in the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Government and that this consensus could
                            not be easily turned around. <gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PVARE1">Peet</persName> felt certain that <gloss
                                target="#t_SECDEF1">SecDef</gloss> would want specific illustrations
                            showing change in Yugoslav conduct. He volunteered to help AMB.
                                <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> but repeated that only
                            specifics would do the job. Amb. <persName corresp="#p_TM9"
                                >TOON</persName> said that it would be difficult to meet such a

                            <persName corresp="#p_PVARE1">Peet</persName> felt that under current

                            allowed to suggest even remotely that the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> was groveling. He added that unless the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> takes a firm stance with Yugoslavia, and
                            most of the countries in the Middle East in addition, they would
                            continue to kick us in the shins with a net loss to the <gloss

                            interest in generating cooperation with Yugoslavia was not a favor to
                            that country. Rather it was in our national interest to counterbalance
                            other influences present there. For example, he had tried to get a
                                <gloss target="#t_SECDEF1">SecDef</gloss> visit to Yugoslavia as a
                            counter balance to similar Soviet visits. <gloss target="#t_ADM1"

                            recent Yugoslav policy had reopened the whole question of a visit. Amb

                        <p>BGen Lobdell pointed out that the Yugoslavs had given us no response to

                            frequent prods. BGen Lobdell considered it hard to understand how the
                            Yugoslavs could be seriously pursuing closer relations and still not be
                            responsive to a relatively low-level proposal like the Olmstead
                                Scholar.<gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_PVARE1">Peet</persName> added that there had also
                            been evidence of a great deal of Yugoslav foot dragging on <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> offers in the past. BGen Lobdell
                            reminded the group that there had been no substantive results or even
                            personal communications resulting from the visit of Major General Alagic
                            and the Yugoslav Air Force Team last fall. Amb. <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> acknowledged these circumstances
                            but said that the important thing to remember is that the military will
                            be a key factor after <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> goes.
                            It is to our advantage to know the Yugoslav military personally in order
                            to know what they are <pb n="3" xml:id="d67-03" facs="d67-03"/>thinking.
                            The Ambassador said that high-level visits could accomplish this
                            purpose. <gloss target="#t_ADM1">ADM</gloss>

                        <p>BGen Lobdell asked for Amb <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName>'s
                            views on Yugoslav interaction with the Soviets. Was the Yugoslav
                            position tilting more toward Moscow? Amb <persName corresp="#p_TM9"
                                >TOON</persName> replied that the Yugoslav-Soviet relationship had
                            warmed up, but as a result of change in Soviet behavior, not in Yugoslav
                            behavior. Secondly, Amb. <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName>
                            thought that Yugoslavia may be moving more eastward economically because
                            of increasing trade barriers associated with the Common Market. Thirdly,
                            he thought that the Yugoslavs may be favorably impressed by the easy
                            Soviet credits offered them. However, he concluded that these factors
                            have not tipped the balance. Yugoslavia is still pro-west in its trade
                            interests; there is still a very large Western credit presence in the
                            country; and the Yugoslavs are determined to be free and non-aligned. In
                            sum, he could not see a move toward Moscow. The Ambassador added that
                            the Yugoslavs know the Soviets far better than we. The Soviets have a
                            long memory, and the Yugoslavs know it. The Soviets could harbor
                            resentment against the Yugoslavs for being fundamentally responsible for
                            the breakup of solidarity among the Communist nations. The current
                            tightening of internal controls in Yugoslavia could be a result of an
                            eye on Moscow. Amb <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> said that
                            it was Marshal <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s view that
                            Yugoslavia would need a tight Party and a strong military after his
                            death.</p>

                            General</p>
                        <p>After opening pleasantries, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF1"
                                >Ellsworth</persName> asked Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM9"
                                >TOON</persName> for the Ambassador's assessment of <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Yugoslav relations. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> replied that up until this morning
                            he had been convinced that the relationship between the two countries
                            was good and improving. However, this morning the Atomic Energy
                            Commission had made it known that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            has insufficient capacity to produce enriched uranium to meet existing
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> commitments. This development
                            affected commitments previously made to a large number of countries,
                            including Yugoslavia. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM9"
                                >TOON</persName> said that the AEC announcement would put him very
                            much on the spot with the Government of Yugoslavia. He had travelled
                            throughout Yugoslavia as a salesman for <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> technology and had spoken personally with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> on the desirability of
                            “buying American,” particularly with regard to nuclear technology. In
                            the wake of an announcement that the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            does not have sufficient enriched uranium as promised, Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> said that his credibility
                            in Belgrade would suffer. Particularly disturbing to him was the fact
                            that <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Yugoslav relations have been very
                            much on the upswing since the low of last fall.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d69-02" facs="d69-02"/>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> said that the
                            Yugoslavs have shown a new awareness and appreciation for sensitive
                            areas in <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> foreign policy. Furthermore,
                            we in the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had learned a great deal
                            lately about the way in which we must deal with Yugoslavia. In the first
                            place, we understand better what it means for the <gloss
                                target="#t_GOY1">GOY</gloss> to be communist but also free. In
                            addition, we have gained a better understanding of the Yugoslav position
                            as a leader in non-aligned movement. For example, as the movement became
                            more radical, the Yugoslavs were required to assume some radical
                            positions in order to maintain their role of leadership.</p>
                        <p>It is, terribly important, continued Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName>, that we understand that Yugoslavia
                            is a free and independent communist country which is nevertheless
                            “anti-imperialistic.” We should also see that our basic national
                            interests require that Yugoslavia remain outside the Warsaw Pact and
                            that this objective, alone is reason enough for the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> to maintain good relations with
                            Yugoslavia. The keystone of our relationship should be that both sides
                            maintain the willingness to talk while treating each other's positions
                            with respect.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName> asked the
                            Ambassador's recommendation with regard to military-to-military
                            contacts. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> replied
                            that we should resume them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF1"
                                >Ellsworth</persName> wondered how necessary they were. Are low
                            level talks important he asked? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM9"
                                >TOON</persName> said that low level military contacts were
                            important but not imperative. What the Yugoslavs are really after is
                            balance for their dealings with Marshal Grechko, the Soviet Minister of
                            Defense. For this purpose, the Yugoslavs would like a visit by Secretary
                            Schlesinger. If we could not accomplish this, added Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName>, then we ought to resume elsewhere,
                            at lower levels. He recalled the success of the visit to Yugoslavia of
                            Major General ROBERTS in the fall of 1972. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName> noted that the sale of
                            military equipment had appeared to be an important objective of our
                            military-to-military contacts. However, we in <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                                >DOD</gloss> were not convinced that there had been progress. The
                            Yugoslavs had seemed so vague on what equipment they wanted from us.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> responded that
                            what the Yugoslavs want is a dialogue. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF1"
                                >Ellsworth</persName> said that, on the occasion of Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_GT2">Granfil</persName>'s call on Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_SJR1">Schlesinger</persName> last August, we
                            had offered them the opportunity for a freewheeling dialogue by having
                            the military attache call in <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> for
                            discussions on any subject at any time he wanted. However, in private
                            the attache confided to the <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> desk
                            officer that he could never enter into such a dialogue without specific
                            instructions in each case from Belgrade. This had drawn our attention to
                            Ambassador Granfil's inference that a meaningful dialogue could only get

                            had been initiated by <gloss target="#t_ASD1">ASD</gloss>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName> inquired whether or
                            not he might profitably visit Belgrade in connection with his travel to
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_NPG1">NPG</gloss> meeting in Rome next November.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> said that he would
                            rather have the <gloss target="#t_ASD1">ASD</gloss> come to Belgrade
                            from another capital. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF1"
                                >Ellsworth</persName> thought that he might be able to stop off in
                            Vienna prior to coming to Belgrade. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> thought highly of this suggestion.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName> continued that he
                            might then stop off In Geneva after Belgrade. BG Lobdell said that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName>'s suggestion was in
                            line with the kind of arrangements that were previously made in planning
                            visits for senior defense officials in Yugoslavia. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> thought that it would be a good
                            idea if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName> were to
                            come to Belgrade next fall with a change of policy in hand, particularly
                            with regard to selling arms to Yugoslavia. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> repeated that it is a good idea to
                            offer the Yugoslavs an alternative to remain independent from the Soviet
                            Union. We were well down the road to interrupting that dependence last
                            year, added Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName>, when
                            Yugoslav actions forced us to interrupt our program. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName> said that his visit and any
                            modification of policy would be a decision of the Secretary of Defense.
                            Before responding to the Ambassador's invitation, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName> said he would discuss the
                            matter with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR1"
                            >Schlesinger</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF1"
                                >Ellsworth</persName> added that the Secretary had not recently been
                            inclined to modify current <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> policy
                            toward military contacts with Yugoslavia.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> next turned to the
                            subject of military exercises in the Northern Adriatic involving <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> forces. He recalled how the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> had been caught in the middle of the
                            Italian-Yugoslav dispute over Trieste early this year because of our
                            participation in the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Exercise
                            (DARK IMAGE 74) in the Adriatic. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM9"
                                >TOON</persName> argued that it was necessary to consider political
                            factors connected with such exercises and that under the circumstances
                            he would like there to be no exercises involving <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> forces in the Adriatic for the foreseeable future--at
                            least until the Yugoslavs and Italians are talking again. Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> said-that he understands
                            military requirements for exorcises but that political factors must bear
                            on them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName> said that
                            as a general rule, he could not accept the logic that political factors
                            ought to inexorably cause us to abandon exercises in the North Adriatic.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> replied that for
                            the time being at least we ought not to be involved in an exercise like
                            FLINTLOCK 74 coming up in August and September. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_TM9">TOON</persName> thought that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> Ambassador to Italy would very likely
                            agree with excluding <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> involvement in
                            Adriatic exercises for the time being. After discussing the nature of
                            the exercise, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName> said
                            that he would take Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TM9"
                            >TOON</persName>'s viewpoint under consideration.</p>

                            already said, our time is very short. It was a very good opportunity for

                            subjects of peripheral concern to you, why don't you tell me the

                            which is important to our overall relations.</p>
                        <p>On my part, as Prime Minister of this government, I can say our relations
                            are developing very well in a spirit of friendship. I nevertheless
                            consider further efforts should be made to develop our relations because
                            they represent a substantial element of our foreign policies. We should
                            like to expand our relations with your country and cooperation on the
                            basis of the Joint Statement, which is very well known to you and
                            represents a constant in our relations. With pleasure, I can say the
                            so-far-achieved results are good. This is valid for all fields of our
                            cooperation -- scientific, cultural, economic and others.</p>
                        <p>On our part we intend to continue to develop our cooperation further,
                            laying emphasis on its further expansion. There is quite a large scope
                            of issues and possibilities to further expand our cooperation, though I
                            already said we can be satisfied with the already-achieved results.</p>
                        <p>Let me say first we have developed Yugoslavia's economy to such an extent
                            that further expansion is needed. In this policy of economic and trade
                            expansion, we consider the United States one of the most serious
                            partners for Yugoslavia. Although we could have achieved more,
                            nevertheless the results this year were satisfactory, amounting to
                            $650-700 million both <pb n="3" xml:id="d70-03" facs="d70-03"/>ways.
                            There is a willingness on the part of our businessmen and their
                            counterparts in the United States to develop this, on the basis of your
                            technology and developing your knowhow in Yugoslavia's economy.</p>
                        <p>Apart from trade cooperation, you know we decided to build our first
                            nuclear power plant in cooperation with Westinghouse, which will be
                            financed by the <gloss target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> Bank and some
                            others. On the basis of contracts concluded with our partner in America,
                            part of this plant will be produced in Yugoslavia as well. We are in
                            contact with your financial institutions, particularly the <gloss
                                target="#t_EXIM1">EXIM</gloss> Bank, especially bearing in mind this
                            is an institution which finances modern technology and equipment, in
                            which we have an interest.</p>
                        <p>We also are keeping in contact with your country to make possible a
                            pattern of preferential tariffs to be applied to Yugoslavia as well.</p>
                        <p>Another very important moment in economic cooperation is the further
                            investment of American capital in Yugoslavian firms. There was a special
                            law adopted in Yugoslavia regarding joint ventures with firms from
                            abroad. The first are steps already made. It is encouraging, but further
                            steps are needed to expand cooperation in this field. We are especially
                            delighted that the decision on guarantees for investment in Yugoslavia
                            was adopted.</p>
                        <p>There are other fields in which our cooperation should be further
                            expanded; science and culture.</p>
                        <p>Then military cooperation is further possible. I must say cooperation in
                            this has not been satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is because every
                            time we are thinking about it, there is some violent speech about us in
                            Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD3">Bijedic</persName>: If necessary, then today
                            I can tell you more about this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: Yes. Not about the
                            violent speeches, but about military cooperation. In principle we are
                            prepared to discuss this. In fact I have a concrete suggestion.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD3">Bijedic</persName>: This is very good. But
                            when we are thinking of talking in principle, concrete ideas are
                            important too. We must clarify which are those on which we can further
                            develop our long-term cooperation.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d70-04" facs="d70-04"/>
                        <p>First of all, military cooperation has been frozen but we are not to
                            blame for that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That is not our
                            perception of the problem, but let's not waste time on that.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD3">Bijedic</persName>: When we want to purchase
                            certain arms from you, then a ban is imposed. [Laughter] The same
                            happens with certain other <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: That's not quite the
                            causal connection.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD3">Bijedic</persName>: Let's talk about that. If
                            you give us cannons and no ammunition, that is not cooperation. I have
                            to ask our Minister of Defense if we will have ammunition tomorrow. As
                            for the speeches, you have to take us as we are. We're not going to give
                            up our principles. Really if we want to discuss things, that is one
                            thing, but there is no need to keep reexamining the behavior of
                            Yugoslavia, because that doesn't allow cooperation to develop.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I have explained in
                            detail with the Foreign Minister what our concerns are. We respect and
                            value Yugoslavia's independence. The reason we cooperate with Yugoslavia
                            is precisely because of this independence. But we discussed in detail
                            some of our specific concerns, and no doubt the Prime Minister will get
                            the records of that discussion. We are prepared to cooperate with you in
                            all of the fields you have mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Are you finished, Mr. Prime Minister? I didn't want to interrupt.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD3">Bijedic</persName>: I prefer this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: The military field
                            first. The best way to proceed would be to send some official from our
                            Defense Department here, who could discuss concrete issues. Our
                            Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs is
                            going to be in the Middle East early this month, and we could ask him to
                            stop here November 15th or 16th. That would be a more efficient way of
                            discussing your defense requirements than discussing them in the
                            abstract here. Obviously if you have American cannons you must have
                            ammunition to go with it. That's irrespective of the state of our
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD3">Bijedic</persName>: There has been no
                            ammunition for three years.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d70-05" facs="d70-05"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: You should have it. It
                            is obvious it won't be used against us. That we'll do something about.
                            The other matter is other equipment, and that you should discuss with
                            the Assistant Secretary of Defense. And he will have instructions to
                            deal with you sympathetically. Is November 15th or 16th all right?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD3">Bijedic</persName>: I can't tell you about
                            the date, but on the other side, we will be happy to receive your
                            Assistant Secretary of Defense and discuss concrete things with him.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He happens to be in
                            the area, but we could arrange another trip. Let our Ambassador
                            know.</p>
                        <p>Mojsov: We are in contact. That can be arranged.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: He'll also be in the
                            area in December. We would arrange it then December 10th or 11th. You
                            let our Ambassador know which is more convenient.</p>
                        <p>In the economic field we are prepared to expand our cooperation. I
                            welcome this plant Westinghouse is building in cooperation with its
                            Yugoslavian counterpart. Again this is the sort of thing I was talking
                            with the Foreign Minister about -- additional consultation in various
                            fields, in which experts could get together and discuss cooperation in
                            various fields. And we can discuss whether it should be here or in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD3">Bijedic</persName>: I can say our cooperation
                            could be promoted and further developed and be firm and stable over the
                            long term. For all fields of our cooperation, some of which I've already
                            touched on in the beginning. It will be possible for us on the basis of
                            stable and long-term cooperation to speak with our people and tell them
                            it will be long-term. Otherwise they ask us: “Who can guarantee that a
                            reexamination won't take place?”</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: This is the concern
                            you have a right to have. We have to distinguish temporary irritations
                            from the long-term problem. We should agree we should deal with each
                            other with some understanding. And I repeat, we welcome Yugoslavia's
                            independence, including from us. I think within generous limits we can
                            handle these problems. And certainly it is our intention to put it on a
                            long-term basis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BD3">Bijedic</persName>: I'm very glad to hear it.
                            Our country is Socialist and nonaligned; our policy is based on
                            principles we won't give up. But we are prepared to have friendship.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: We already have more
                            allies than we can deal with. We are not looking for any more.

                            <persName corresp="#p_BD3">Bijedic</persName>: I reiterate we do wish to
                            preserve our relations with all countries. At the same time, we have our
                            principles. We are trying to do both. We keep coming across people who
                            don't like this or that move of Yugoslavia.</p>

                            problem. I don't think you have to give up your principles or compromise
                            them in order to cooperate with the United States.</p>
                        <p>

                            Misunderstandings occasionally occur. Diplomatic services exist in two

                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: I wish to welcome you to
                            Belgrade today even though I recognize that this is only a short visit.
                            It is also some time since you have been here. The last time I believe
                            on President <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>'s trip.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: It is too short a period but we should have a good opportunity
                            to exchange views. I want to thank you for your warm reception. I have
                            already had very useful talks.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: Yes, I know. With the
                            Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d71-02" facs="d71-02"/>
                        <p>SECRETARY: I would like to leave to you, Mr. President, what we talk
                            about.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: It is difficult to know
                            where to start. There are so many problems. How about bilateral
                            issues?</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Whatever is most on the mind of the President.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: As far as bilateral issues
                            are concerned, the Prime Minister has told you we wish to have good
                            relations and we think it is possible to do this in spite of certain
                            problems that arise.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: That is correct.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: Our relations were good
                            before and after the war but recently there seem to have been some
                            difficulties which I am sure we will overcome and return to those same
                            traditional good relations. We shall certainly do our part but you must
                            understand that we cannot renounce our principles but we can always
                            discuss specific issues. I think the major issue before us today is the
                            Middle East. Naom Goldman was here recently--this is about the 4th time
                            he has come since the '67 war. In our last encounter he was very worried
                            and when he returned to Israel, he sent me a message. In this message he
                            asked me to convey two messages on his behalf--one to Sadat and one to
                            Assad. He would like to meet them. I will, of course, convey these
                            messages.</p>
                        <p>We are, of course, interested in how the situation develops and we too
                            have been <pb n="3" xml:id="d71-03" facs="d71-03"/>very worried. We will
                            have more talks with the Arabs but it is our impression that they wish
                            to freeze the situation.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: I agree. The situation cannot be frozen but all parties seem
                            to be cooperating in freezing it. The Israelis never seem to know how to
                            make concessions in time. I told them a year ago that they had to make a
                            deal with Hussein and, if they had, we would not have had the whole
                            difficulty at Rabat. I told them that this was the only way to get the
                            Palestinians to deal with Hussein and thus make the <gloss
                                target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> an Arab problem. I personally like
                            Sadat and Assad. They are both good men. The trouble seems to me to be
                            that Arabs can never make up their minds whether they want to make
                            policy or epic poetry. The necessities of the present situation are to
                            deal with concrete issues and not vague concepts. I will make sure that
                            the United States keeps bringing its influence to bear to make
                            progress.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: The United States can do
                            the most.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: We are the only ones who can help at this juncture. Every time
                            I see Gromyko he has ten principles, twenty subheads and fifty articles
                            of an agreement but he can never tell me how he would get the agreement
                            accepted. Each Soviet proposal involves getting the United States to
                            agree to something. They then tell the Arabs and get the credit from
                            them and we are supposed to be the <pb n="4" xml:id="d71-04"
                                facs="d71-04"/>ones who get the proposal carried out. This is why we
                            have more or less acted alone. We want to see progress in the
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: I don't know exactly what
                            the present situation is but I have a feeling that relations between
                            Sadat and Assad are better. It is also my impression that the Arabs
                            intend to get their territory back. On the other hand, the Israelis seem
                            to have difficulty with accepting even the proposal of withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: As far as the Israelis are concerned, there appears to be no
                            movement at the present time. The Syrians want to negotiate but the
                            Israelis do not wish to negotiate with them. The Israelis do however
                            wish to negotiate with Sadat. This puts Sadat in an impossible position.
                            I agree with you. I think Assad is a reasonable man.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: He is realistic. He is not
                            a man you cannot talk to.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: If the Israelis were more realistic they could have made an
                            arrangement with Assad. Frankly, I can assure you we will not cooperate
                            in a policy that isolates any Arab state. On the other hand, the Arabs
                            have been mistaken to be so explicit on the <gloss target="#t_PLO1"
                                >PLO</gloss> at this time. We had the Israeli agreement to give back
                            part of the West Bank. They were prepared to negotiate. The time to have
                            raised the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> issue would have been
                            after this was accomplished, not before. Rabat has given the Israelis a
                            good excuse to do nothing. It was a bad tactical decision.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d71-05" facs="d71-05"/>
                        <p>KARDELJ: But the Palestine problem is more of an inter-Arab problem.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Yes, but it is a mistake to make this issue so public. They
                            should have let things go and determined the ultimate position on the
                                <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss> next year. But there is no sense
                            talking about the past. Everyone behaved in a manner designed to create
                            difficulties during this last summer and this coincided of course with
                            our change in Presidents so we couldn't act.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: Now it is getting very
                            late. What effect do you think Rabat will have?</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: I have to say that Sadat has been saying to me since last June
                            that something must happen before the Arab Summit. What can be done? We
                            will do our utmost to achieve progress and this is why I am going to the
                            Middle East again. If there isn't progress then we will all end up in
                            Geneva and I can assure you there will be a stalemate.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: Do you think the Israeli
                            government put Goldman up to going to see Sadat and Assad?</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: I don't believe so. I doubt it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: In the old days Goldman
                            wanted me to arrange meetings with Nasser.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: There is no harm in his seeing Sadat and Assad although I must
                            say the first <pb n="6" xml:id="d71-06" facs="d71-06"/>exposure to Assad
                            can be an exciting experience. I don't believe the Israeli government
                            has authorized Goldman to see anyone. We have to move the Israeli
                            government and this is where the Arabs have to help. If we want to avoid
                            an explosion in the United States, we must avoid people putting forward
                            total solutions. What this does is to maximize the chance of turning
                            U.S. opinion against our government's efforts. We are not asking you or
                            others to give up your own positions but I believe that the Arab leaders
                            now understand why we have to go step by step. Certainly Sadat
                            understands. Assad would if the Israelis could just shut up. We are
                            prepared to use pressure but we cannot survive unless we move on a step
                            by step course.</p>
                        <p>KARDELJ: But if you move step by step can you do this in parallel on all
                            the issues at the same time?</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: We certainly cannot agree to separate final peace agreements.
                            They would have to occur together. That would be out of the question. My
                            personal judgment is that we must move one step at a time, country by
                            country. We will assure that no Arab country is isolated. Our strategy
                            is to deal with our opponents in the United States who say that Syria is
                            a Soviet satellite--therefore anything involving Syria is especially
                            difficult. In the next phase, we wish to have some movement on the
                            Egyptian side and then begin on Syria. If the Arabs insist, we will try
                            to deal with both countries at the same time. I can only give you my
                            judgment as to what is feasible.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: Moving one by one has
                            military implications. If you settle with one state, there is less
                            chance of having to fight all of them together and I don't believe any
                            Arab country would agree to a separate peace.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: You are probably right. But I can also tell you that we will
                            not tolerate an Israeli attack on any Arab state.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: It is very important to
                            settle this matter peacefully. It can be useful to Israel. After all,
                            there is a tremendous gap between the advanced economy of Israel and
                            that of its Arab neighbors. They should be helping each other.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: The trouble with Israel is that they can win battles but not
                            the whole war-- they cannot settle this matter using any strategic
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>KARDELJ: Still there was a major change since the Arabs at Rabat accepted
                            the existence of the State of Israel by confirming that only Gaza and
                            the West Bank would become Palestinian.</p>
                        <p>MINIC: Israel should think over long and hard its extreme policies.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: You are right. The major adjustments are needed in Israel's
                            thinking. But there is a basic dilemma that they must face. Perhaps it
                            is best illustrated by a story that my colleagues have heard many times.
                            I met an Israeli who told <pb n="8" xml:id="d71-08" facs="d71-08"/>me
                            that he prays for my efforts and that he would give ten years of his
                            life for peace. I said that my problem was trying to establish a line on
                            the Golan Heights and asked him how many kilometers he would give for
                            peace. He replied, not one meter. That is the dilemma--the Israelis want
                            peace but they are not prepared to pay for it. Given this extremely
                            difficult situation on all sides, it seems to us that everyone who
                            wishes to see peace in the area should counsel restraint. If war should
                            come, we would of course support Israel and the Soviets would support
                            the Arabs. It reminds me very much of the Balkans in pre-WWI. All of our
                            friends should urge restraint to avoid this situation from developing.
                            We have to deal with the opposition in the United States and the
                            opposition of Israel. Concretely, I will be back in the United States
                            only one week before the President and I leave for Japan, Korea and
                            Vladivostok. We cannot take on any more serious activity until both the
                            President and I are back in the country at the same time. I am speaking
                            very frankly to you--anyone can have a declaration.</p>
                        <p>Can we change the subject now? Could the President give me his thoughts
                            on what is going on in the Soviet Union or would he rather not speak
                            about it?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: We don't see any change.
                            There was a good crop this year and there does not seem to be any
                            misunderstanding or crisis. We feel that there is a consolidation <pb
                                n="9" xml:id="d71-09" facs="d71-09"/>in the internal situation. As
                            you may know, <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName> is coming
                            here, then perhaps we will know more. Otherwise our relations are good
                            and you should not believe all the things you see in the boulevard
                            press. There is nothing to the reports of continuing threats by the
                            Soviet troops. The Soviets couldn't try anything -- they are too
                            clever.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: They are probably more cautious than clever.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: Our overall relationships
                            with the Soviet Union are good. Trade is developing well and is now at
                            the level of 1.4 billion. They are our second trading partner after the
                            West Germans. I also think that they do not want a confrontation with
                            the U.S. They are very interested in the <gloss target="#t_CSCE1"
                                >CSCE</gloss> and believe that will have repercussions on other
                            questions because they will not wish to make any move that might
                            compromise the results of that conference. I believe they also want
                            peace in the Middle East because they know that without it it may lead
                            to confrontation with the U.S.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: The Soviets cannot make a military move, especially in
                            Yugoslavia without confronting the U.S. You should not pay any attention
                            to rumors of our talking together or not taking actions. We will always
                            react violently to any military moves on their side. But in terms of the
                            present situation, we too want an atmosphere leading to the relaxation
                                <pb n="10" xml:id="d71-10" facs="d71-10"/>of tension. But we will
                            not give up our basic interest even though we are in favor of improving
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: Detente is useful because
                            it makes it easier to solve problems and there are hundreds of them
                            confronting us.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Yes, we are not short of problems.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: I would like to say a word
                            about Italy today. We are interested in having good neighborly
                            relations. Unfortunately, the private talks we were having have not
                            reached any agreement because their government is so frail.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Yes, they complicate life for all of us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: We feel that we may also
                            have to help the Italians too.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: What we are seeking to establish is an institutional solution
                            to the economic crisis which confronts all of the developed countries.
                            Energy is only one aspect of the problem. I will make a proposal in the
                            next month to deal with this great economic problem. It is no use for
                            the Italians to borrow $2 billion from the Germans and then probably
                            have to do the same thing again in a few months' time.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: Yes, Schmidt told me that
                            it was difficult to convince public opinion in Germany to pay more taxes
                            to give to Italy. He thought it might be as much as $6 billion.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d71-11" facs="d71-11"/>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Even $6 billion is only a deficit for one year.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: Inflation is choking all
                            of us.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: We will come up with a more comprehensive approach.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: Will this deal with
                            inflation?</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: No, only indirectly. It will deal with the financial problem
                            caused by the energy crisis.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: We should not just look at
                            the energy problem, but rather we should examine the question of all raw
                            materials.</p>
                        <p>KARDELJ: There is a question of how to get out of the dilemma of
                            confrontation. We need democratic international institutions to deal
                            with all the problems by the developed and less-developed countries.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: You are right -- these problems cannot be solved by
                            confrontation. On the other hand, many of the problems that the
                            developed countries face are internal. The deficits that Italy has in
                            its balance of payments are more really a problem for the oil producers.
                            We must, of course, always keep open the possibility of discussing these
                            issues with producers but first we must have consumer cooperation so
                            that we know what it is we wish to talk about. There is an old saying
                            that, if you don't know where you are going, any road will get you
                            there. What good will high prices do for the producers if inflation is
                                <pb n="12" xml:id="d71-12" facs="d71-12"/>going to make all the
                            things they wish to buy more expensive. Already the funds that they have
                            earned are greatly depreciated. A reasonable solution must be in the
                            interest of both the consumers and the producers.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: The <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>s have suffered the most. They are the
                            hardest hit. The U.S. and the Soviet Union less so.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: It is true that they have been badly hit, but they cannot just
                            press to have the problem solved overnight.</p>
                        <p>KARDELJ: This just proves that the whole world system should be used to
                            solve this problem by an institutional agreement.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: I will be making the same point when I speak tomorrow at the
                            World Food Conference. We cannot solve this problem except by planning
                            on a global basis. The paradox is that the U.S. favors global planning
                            and the Soviet Union is in favor of a free market. We feel we have to
                            allocate our scarce agriculture production in agreement with others who
                            need to buy. The Soviet Union wishes to get into our market and buy up
                            stocks through secret agreement. We cannot allow this. We need food for
                            Egypt, Syria and India. We need information in advance from countries
                            like the Soviet Union to see how much we have available to allocate.</p>
                        <p>MINIC: That could be a good way to proceed and we would think that
                            similar ways could be found to move along the same lines. <pb n="13"
                                xml:id="d71-13" facs="d71-13"/>Perhaps also there could be some link
                            with non-aligned states who would cooperate with such a system.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: On the food problem, I think the non-aligned countries will
                            support what we are proposing but the same principles must be
                            applied.</p>
                        <p>MINIC: This is the problem of integrating our economies in a world system
                            in a time of crisis. We discussed these same issues at the Special
                            Session of the General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: The trouble with the Special Session was that it seemed to be
                            based on a confrontation of the non-aligned countries and the developed
                            countries. What we really need is a spirit of cooperation on both sides.
                            The injustices that have grown up over the last century cannot be cured
                            in a few years--even five years. An atmosphere of confrontation is not a
                            good way to proceed.</p>
                        <p>MINIC: We think that the non-aligned countries favor cooperation not
                            confrontation. What do you think are the special points of interest? We
                            all want overall cooperation.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Our idea, and we have expressed this in commenting on the
                            Mexican proposal for a declaration of rights and duties, is that if the
                            proposals are reasonable, we will support them but as the debate has
                            gone on, the proposals have gotten more unreasonable and we may now be
                                <pb n="14" xml:id="d71-14" facs="d71-14"/>forced to vote against
                            these proposals because they have been radically changed but basically
                            we agree with the direction.</p>
                        <p>KARDELJ: The difficulty here is that we need to exercise more patience.
                            Many of these countries are backward and have only recently emerged from
                            colonial status. They have enormous problems and they are pressed by
                            radical elements who want overnight progress.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: I think that is true.</p>
                        <p>KARDELJ: If we all work together this can be a pre-condition of a
                            dialogue but we need to do something concrete to solve these problems. A
                            few years ago no one believed detente would be possible but now it looks
                            as though it may make some progress.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: You will see this same theme in the speech that I am going to
                            make tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>MINIC: The less-developed countries feel that no one sufficiently
                            understands the seriousness of their situation. That is the obstacle to
                            cooperation. There is the same feeling among the <gloss target="#t_LDC1"
                                >LDC</gloss>'s against the Socialist states and the Soviet
                            Union.</p>
                        <p>KARDELJ: Yes, we have the same situation here.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: No. We recognize the problem. You will see in the speech I
                            give tomorrow and you will also note that there will be strong criticism
                            in the United States <pb n="15" xml:id="d71-15" facs="d71-15"/>for what
                            I am going to say. In fact, in preparing this speech I found that all
                            the domestic agencies were opposed. This is the first time that the
                            United States will have advocated global planning and allocation, as
                            well as the development of reserves.</p>
                        <p>I am going to the Middle East after Rome and probably the criticism of my
                            food speech will start while I am in the Middle East but they will
                            probably understand better in the Middle East what I am trying to do.
                            Dealing with the Middle Eastern problems is very difficult indeed but I
                            particularly enjoy meetings with Assad. I recall my first encounter with
                            him when we were talking about the problem of starting the Geneva talks.
                            For three hours we discussed procedure and agenda and got it all
                            settled. Then there was the question of the letter of invitation. The
                            Israelis came back and asked for two changes in the letter and the
                            Syrians accepted this. I began to wonder why everyone said it was so
                            difficult to deal with the Syrians when in three hours' time I had
                            managed to settle all the outstanding issues. Then I made a fatal
                            mistake and I asked Assad if there was anything in the letter that
                            bothered him. He said that he agreed completely with the letter except
                            for one sentence where it said that the parties would come to the Geneva
                            Conference. He said the only thing wrong with the letter is I am not
                            going to Geneva. But seriously I like him. He has great courage and he's
                            thoughtful.</p>
                        <pb n="16" xml:id="d71-16" facs="d71-16"/>
                        <p>I talked to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>
                            about the Cyprus situation. We support an independent sovereign Cyprus
                            and we respect its territorial integrity. We think that realistically
                            there will have to be a federal system based on some geographic
                            principles. I am, of course, planning to go to Ankara where I hope to
                            get some Turkish gestures that will improve the atmosphere and will
                            enable the talks between Denktash and Clerides to continue.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: I doubt very much that the
                            Greeks will accept a geographic solution--they will only talk about a
                            cantonal solution with a strong central government.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Yes, there should be a strong central government if for no
                            other reason than to control immigration. We are not opposed to a
                            cantonal solution if the parties will agree to it. But I must tell you
                            frankly that I don't think a cantonal solution will be accepted. Let me
                            also say that we had nothing to do with the coup against Makarios. There
                            was no conceivable interest in our attempting to unsettle conditions in
                            the eastern Mediterranean in July of 1974. We had great difficulty
                            internally in our own country with the Presidential crisis and there
                            were also difficulties in the Middle East. We certainly did not wish to
                            cause an additional problem in the eastern Mediterranean. I can assure
                            you that we were not aware of any coup planning. This whole matter has
                            been a nuisance.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: The results were certainly
                            bad.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: The results were predictable and there was no doubt that the
                            Turks would move and we tried to prevent this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: We were not against the
                            first move but later on we did not agree with Turkish actions.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: The first intervention made the second one inevitable.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM9">MINIC</persName>: Also there was a failure at
                            the Geneva Conference.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: We had Turkish agreement on August 8 and 9 to a cantonal plan
                            but Mavros refused to discuss it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: Now even Makarious is
                            interested in discussing it.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: If we could get now what was offered in the summer we would be
                            called geniuses. The Turks wanted only a third of Famagusta but Mavros
                            refused to accept any of this. Callaghan was so angry he wouldn't talk
                            about it. We couldn't even find out what was going on. We asked for a
                            delay of 72 hours. All this was going on while we were changing
                            Presidents. Personally, I believe that some Turkish gestures will be
                            given. Then after the election in Greece the situation can move toward a
                            negotiated solution. Now it is impossible for Karamanlis to make
                            concessions. But it is also not in Karamanlis' <pb n="18"
                                xml:id="d71-18" facs="d71-18"/>interest to drag this problem on very
                            much longer. I think Ecevit is a reasonable man. The objective
                            conditions exist to make progress if there is a Turkish Government that
                            can act.</p>
                        <p>KARDELJ: What about the extremists?</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Makarios should stay out of Cyprus until there is preliminary
                            agreement. If you have influence, you should try to make him see things
                            that way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: We have very good
                            relations with him. He has agreed in principle to a political
                            negotiation. I agree that it is probably better if he stays out.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: He talks about going back by the end of the month.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">TITO</persName>: Yes, that is what he
                            says.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: He is talking about resigning as President but staying on as
                            spiritual leader. Personally, I think he is better qualified to be
                            President than religious leader.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM9">MINIC</persName>: He did support the <gloss

                        <p>SECRETARY: Yes, he did. His major role should be to support the solution
                            worked out by Clerides and Denktash. If he does that then it might be
                            all right for him to go back.</p>

                        <p>With the letter at Tab B, President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> has expressed his appreciation for the message you
                            sent him on August 10 affirming your commitment to further improving
                            US-Yugoslav relations, and he has extended an invitation to you to visit
                            Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>On September 6, Tito sent you another letter (at Tab C) setting forth in
                            some detail Yugoslav concern over Cyprus, reviewing the diplomatic
                            contacts his government had undertaken on this issue, and expressing the
                            hope that the United States agreed on the need to take every step
                            possible to resolve the crisis as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Our relations with Yugoslavia were subsequently complicated when Tito
                            alleged in a September 12 speech that the <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                >CIA</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> had
                            engineered the Cyprus coup. I took the Yugoslav Foreign Minister to task
                            on this point during our September meeting in New York. During my visit
                            to Belgrade on November 4, I had frank and detailed discussions with
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> and other leading
                            members of the Yugoslav Government, not only on the even-handed approach
                            we are taking toward Cyprus, but also on the need to consult at the
                            government-to-government level rather than voicing any policy
                            disagreement in speeches and in the press. I believe this point was
                            understood and taken well. As the result of the positive tone of these
                            consultations with the Yugoslavs, I believe it would now be appropriate
                            for you to reply to President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName>'s letters.</p>
                        <p>A reply at this time would also be propitious because of recent events in
                            Yugoslavia that have contributed to a more positive attitude toward the
                            United States. In September, Tito revealed that the Soviet Union had
                            been caught -- again -- meddling in Yugoslav internal affairs. The
                            subversive Soviet activity, revealed at its most bungling in the
                            “Cominformist” plot, has angered <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName>, confirmed the Yugoslavs' worst fears that Titoism
                            remains <pb n="2" xml:id="d72-02" facs="d72-02"/>unacceptable to the
                            Soviets and that they will continue their attempts at undermining, and
                            seems to have slightly inclined the Yugoslavs to probe for further
                            expansion of relations with the West.</p>
                        <p>Judging by my talks in Belgrade and the effect of the above events, it is
                            clear that the Yugoslavs, and <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> personally, attach great importance to our visiting
                            Yugoslavia as soon as an acceptable schedule can be arranged. They will
                            value your meeting personally with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> as a fresh and clear U. S. endorsement of Yugoslav
                            independence and non-alignment. In my opinion, such a visit will
                            contribute positively to your foreign policy objectives not only toward
                            Yugoslavia but also in terms of maintaining stability in East-West
                            relations.</p>
                        <p>The reply for your signature to <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> at Tab A would note the exchange of views that has
                            taken place over the past several months and would state the importance
                            you attach to maintaining a continuing dialogue with Yugoslavia on
                            issues of common interest. Your reply would also accept President
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s invitation to visit
                            Yugoslavia, stating that you look forward to identifying a mutually
                            convenient date for the visit.</p>
                        <p>Your letter has been coordinated with Paul Theis.</p>
                        <p>RECOMMENDATION</p>
                        <p>That you sign the letter to President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> at Tab A.</p>

                        <p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: I would like to say again
                            how happy I am to exchange views with the President and his associates
                            and to welcome you here. I am only sorry it is for such a short time. I
                            hope there will be some opportunity for you to visit Yugoslavia
                            unofficially.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: I am most grateful
                            for your personal welcome and for the welcome of the Yugoslav people. My
                            return to Belgrade brought back many memories of twelve years ago when I
                            had a chance to meet many people in your government and establish a
                            relationship. May I congratulate you on your speech and presiding at
                            Helsinki.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: And may I say the same to
                            you as well.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>: I wish we could
                            stay longer. Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName> and would
                            like to return again and enjoy the beauties of Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d73-02" facs="d73-02"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: I would like to hear how
                            you would like to proceed. We don't have much time tonight. I think our
                            bilateral relations are good. We discussed international relations in
                            Helsinki. Maybe we could talk about the future.</p>
                        <p>The President: I agree, Mr. President, that our bilateral relations are
                            excellent. Maybe we could expand on what we touched on earlier -- Greece
                            and Turkey and the Middle East. Those are areas where the threat of
                            conflict is great and the dangers that it could bring are very serious.
                            Maybe we could discuss these things.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: The Middle East is the
                            most troublesome point. I feel that there is some deterioration and that
                            the situation could get more and more complicated. Since it is the most
                            serious, I would suggest discussing it tomorrow.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps we should discuss security in Europe and what we should do to
                            promote it. I think that after Helsinki the moral factor will become
                            important. I have heard that there has been, for example, some new
                            progress between Greece and Turkey in Vienna. I hear there was also
                            progress at SALT.</p>
                        <p>The President: Yes. We made some progress. Not as much as we hoped, but I
                            think sufficient to lay the ground work for an agreement this year. The
                            issues are very technical. While I had hoped for more progress, we did
                            make some and I am reasonably optimistic.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: These talks were just in
                            passing then.</p>
                        <p>The President: Yes, but we are hoping they will lead to something in
                            finality. We are also concerned about <gloss target="#t_MBFR1"
                                >MBFR</gloss>. Do you have any advice for us in this crucial area?
                            We are deadlocked.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: I know very little about
                            them other than the fact that they are deadlocked. Perhaps <persName
                                corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName> can give us something more.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>: I know little more about
                            it. But Palme has made a proposal that the two sides should reduce on
                            each side.</p>
                        <p>We think reduction would be good also.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: I think there is a
                            connection between the reduction of arms and Helsinki. Otherwise we
                            haven't done much.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d73-03" facs="d73-03"/>
                        <p>The President: I assure you that we will do our best. We have a formula
                            and we will attempt a breakthrough. We think the spirit of Helsinki
                            should push the negotiations forward.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: Reduction of arms
                            certainly falls within the Helsinki concept. It is important not to let
                            things stagnate.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>: Some progress should be
                            made. Otherwise the spirit that we now have would be dissipated.</p>
                        <p>The President: There was some implication that <gloss target="#t_CSCE1"
                                >CSCE</gloss> would be followed by <gloss target="#t_MBFR1"
                                >MBFR</gloss>. Not an agreement to do so, only an implication.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: So far each side has
                            proposed disarming the other. But we will put forth a serious proposal
                            this fall and should make some progress.</p>
                        <p>The President: We have turned it off for this year but the Congress, if
                            there is no progress, will renew its efforts to make unilateral force
                            cuts. I will resist, but it could happen.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: I couldn't believe the
                            Congress would do such a thing.</p>
                        <p>The President: My Administration never will. But there are members who
                            would do so. Thus far they are a minority.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: In 1977, after your
                            elections, there will be a summing up of the Helsinki follow-on.</p>
                        <p>The President: I am looking forward to attending it as President.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: All the international
                            conferences held in Belgrade have been successful. For example, the
                            first non-aligned conference.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: It is now bigger than
                            the two blocs! It's the biggest bloc now.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: It is not a bloc.
                            [Laughter]. There have been some rocky days in the non-aligned group,
                            but we will get by. It is not good to be exclusive groups. We will
                            discuss it tomorrow. I would like you to understand our position.</p>
                        <p>The President: I know you can imagine how much time I, and I assume
                                <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>, have spent working
                            to implement the Vladivostok accord. We think that dividing the world
                            into blocs is not the best way to deal with the <pb n="4"
                                xml:id="d73-04" facs="d73-04"/>problems. In the kind of world we
                            live in today, there can't be the kind of confrontation and military
                            activity which took place during your time and mine. I will dedicate
                            myself to eliminating those sources of conflict that could lead to
                            military confrontation. Our orientation will be that way.</p>
                        <p>As I was saying earlier, I recall Dulles saying how important it was to
                            establish a good relationship with Yugoslavia. Over the years that
                            relationship has grown and expanded and been highly beneficial to both
                            sides and to the world. The American people as a result have developed a
                            great affection for the Yugoslav people. The American people -- if I can
                            say it in the right way -- sometimes don't understand criticism of our
                            actions. The feeling for Yugoslavia is very strong, and under those
                            circumstances criticism is easily misunderstood. So I would hope we
                            could each moderate our statements.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: I quite agree. A criticism
                            can be expressed with friendly words or in a not friendly way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>: Yugoslavia is entrusted
                            with the preparation for the 1977 Conference so we will need
                            consultation with all the parties.</p>
                        <p>The President: We will cooperate completely.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>: In past times we have had
                            close cooperation between the foreign ministers and the ambassadors of
                            our two countries.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>: I agree. We hope to
                            continue to consult -- and we will consult before the Special Session
                            next month because we want to make a constructive effort.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: We also want to be
                            constructive. We have had many contacts with the heads of government in
                            Helsinki and with others with whom we have disagreements, and we agree
                            we won't let the press lead our relations. But if there are differences,
                            we will meet and talk them out.</p>
                        <p>The President: I have a very close and personal relationship with
                            Secretary Kissinger. There are no differences between us. And the
                            Ambassador is my appointment. He has my full confidence, so we have a
                            good situation.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: That is the best way --
                            only a few sources for passing information.</p>
                        <p>The President: At the top, information should come to me through the
                            Secretary. But Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SLH1"
                                >Silberman</persName> does have my complete confidence.</p>

                            importance to the understanding between Yugoslavia and the United
                            States, given the standing of Yugoslavia in the non-aligned world, and
                            we will do our best to say in close contact.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: What kind of tree did you
                            plant?</p>
                        <p>The President: It was a Colorado pine and I was helped by the Secretary
                            of State, my son and the Secretary's son. Us old men need young people
                            to help us. I felt that way even more this morning when I went out for a
                            swim. The water was very cold but that is a beautiful pool that you
                            have.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: We can now resume our
                            talks. What priority do you want to give to the issues?</p>
                        <p>The President: Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>
                            has brought to my attention a very shocking situation which is of deep
                            concern to all of us and I would like to have him tell you about it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: This concerns an act of terrorism. The Japanese Red Army
                            has taken some 40 American citizens and 3 Swedes and captured them. They
                            are demanding the release of 7 Japanese terrorists in Japan. Our
                            position is, as it has always been, that we refuse to negotiate and to
                            pay ransom in these cases. We do this in order not to encourage the
                            capture of other Americans for the same purpose. We refuse to discuss
                            the case with anyone. In Tanzania one of our Ambassadors violated this
                            rule and he will now be released. The American Government will always
                            refuse to negotiate because that is the only way we can keep demands
                            from being made upon us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: How many Japanese are
                            there?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: Seven, and they have a machine gun. They all seem to be on
                            one floor and they fire the gun from time to time. The Japanese <pb
                                n="3" xml:id="d74-03" facs="d74-03"/>have asked for an airline plane
                            to take the prisoners from Japan and then to come to Kuala Lumpur and
                            pick up the terrorists. They've extended the deadline twice now and it's
                            due to come up again at 10:30 this morning our time.</p>
                        <p>The President: It's our strong feeling that if we were to breach this
                            hard line that we take there would be no end to the demands being made
                            upon us. We have to be tough and that is right in the long run.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: There seem to be a large
                            number of people involved and, of course, this kind of terrorist is
                            ready for suicide.</p>
                        <p>The President: Yes, they are sort of kamikazes.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: These Japanese are the same ones responsible for the Tel
                            Aviv killings.</p>
                        <p>The President: If we could move on to the Middle East in which we both
                            have a deep interest, I would like to make a general comment. Because of
                            your interests and the impact that Yugoslavia can make in the situation
                            I would like to fill you in on our thinking and also to hear your
                            views.</p>
                        <p>We are convinced that if a stalemate continues, war is inevitable in the
                            Middle East and this time it will be bloodier, more costly and could
                            involve a confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union.
                            All of this could be avoided if we could make progress toward a solution
                            on the basis of UN Resolutions 242 and 338. What we need is to have some
                            time and this is why we have been in favor of an interim settlement.
                            This is not an easy question and we <pb n="4" xml:id="d74-04"
                                facs="d74-04"/>have spent a lot of time trying to see whether we can
                            successfully pursue these negotiations. If they break down we face other
                            prospects which would not be good for the world or for the Middle
                            East.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: Our opinion is that the
                            possibility for progress lies with Israel because Israel has not
                            complied with the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolutions which
                            you mentioned, 242 and 338. We had hoped that some results would be
                            achieved from your step by step negotiations--those carried on by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>. But only one
                            step has been achieved. Now we seem to be in a stalemate. We think that
                            Israel shouldn't be allowed to do as it wishes.</p>
                        <p>We think that Israeli behavior has brought about all this talk of the
                            possibility of expulsion from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. It
                            would be a very unhappy development for the UN. It would be bad for the
                            UN and it would bring divisions in the non-aligned world. But Israel
                            continues to violate the will of others and therefore we think more
                            pressure should be put on Israel.</p>
                        <p>In Kampala there was a moderate resolution that was finally passed but
                            there is growing pressure to expel Israel from the UN. Divisions
                            appeared at Kampala. Ghana and Zaire both wanted a more moderate
                            resolution and they were successful but it does show what happens if
                            Israel doesn't change its position--how it can bring about division in
                            the non-aligned world. Sadat was even against the more radical Arab
                            suggestions.</p>
                        <p>You are quite right, we are very much interested in this problem. We have
                            always tried to find a solution. We have exchanged visits with Egypt. I
                            have gone <pb n="5" xml:id="d74-05" facs="d74-05"/>there and they have
                            come here. We always have tried to find a peaceful solution to this
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>I have had several conversations with Naom Goldman, the head of the World
                            Jewish Congress. He is much more realistic and he looks much farther
                            ahead.</p>
                        <p>One has to look to the future. One has to look ten or 15 years ahead when
                            the Arabs will be completely armed; there will be 150 million of them
                            against only 5 or 6 million Israelis. Under such conditions the Arabs
                            might be tempted to do what they threatened to do years ago, that is, to
                            throw Israel into the sea. As a general principle, aggression should not
                            pay. And the country that commits aggression should suffer the
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>I went to Egypt in 1967. KARDELJ was with me and we met with Nasser. I
                            said to him that Israel is a reality and it should be recognized. It is
                            a member of the United Nations. I said there was no way for the Arabs to
                            throw Israel into the sea. They didn't like what I said. They kept
                            silent. But the next day, Nasser said--you are right.</p>
                        <p>I know it is very difficult for Iraq and Syria with the Palestinian
                            situation the way it is but Israel must withdraw and in return it must
                            be recognized as a fact, as a State. As I told Goldman, Israel is a
                            highly developed country that could help its neighbors in peace. Goldman
                            agreed. I'm aware that you can't do these things over night but each
                            step should not take ten years.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d74-06" facs="d74-06"/>
                        <p>The President: In my meeting with Sadat, I got the impression that you
                            have given--that the Arabs are now in a position to recognize Israel. It
                            would be a major step.</p>
                        <p>I look forward to meeting Asad. I have a very favorable impression of
                            him. He seems to be a leader who is willing to be constructive.</p>
                        <p>We have spent a maximum time trying to convince all of the Arab leaders
                            that a move must come and now we are working on Israel. We are in favor
                            of a step forward now but later we recognize that there must be a
                            general settlement.</p>
                        <p>It is of great concern to us that there not be abrupt action in the
                            United Nations. All it would do would be to make Israel a martyr and
                            disturb progress toward a solution. I have sought this solution with all
                            my power and, therefore, I hope that it will be possible for you to urge
                            moderation, particularly before the meeting in Lima.</p>
                        <p>There are good prospects that a step forward can be reached and that this
                            will be a move toward a final negotiation. I think on the basis of what
                            I know of Sadat's attitude and the attitude of Israel that we will be
                            able to take another step. We are prepared to put on significant, very
                            significant, pressure to achieve this.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: I read in today's paper
                            that the international meeting of socialists in Stockholm has adopted a
                            resolution which seems to be very protective of Israel. It seems to me
                            that these unilateral positions do not help. There is no question of
                            protecting <pb n="7" xml:id="d74-07" facs="d74-07"/>Israel or expelling
                            Israel. The two things go together.</p>
                        <p>The President: Our position on the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has
                            to be well spelled-out. We are dedicated to the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. We put a lot of money and time into that organization.
                            But it cannot be organized and controlled by blocs. The Secretary has
                            made a very good speech on the subject in Milwaukee and that is the
                            position of our Government.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, it is Israel's responsibility to make progress within
                            the framework of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolutions. We
                            don't wish Israel to be expelled. And if I may add a postscript to what
                            I have said. If there is no progress, I mentioned at the outset the
                            probability of conflict--perhaps of an oil embargo. The repercussions
                            would be world-wide and indeed the underdeveloped countries would suffer
                            even more but it would also jeopardize economic recovery of the United
                            States. If that were to happen, our capabilities of helping others would
                            certainly be undermined.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it is a matter of maximum importance to avoid these
                            consequences and bring the countries together in the manner that I
                            described. You might be interested in some of the Secretary's
                            observations because he has spent a great deal of time and effort in
                            working on the situation. Therefore, some intimate observations by him
                            might be helpful.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <pb n="8" xml:id="d74-08" facs="d74-08"/>
                        <p>The Secretary: The present outline of our basic approach is that getting
                            together a meeting of all the parties to discuss all the issues would
                            play into the hands of those Israelis who do not wish to have any
                            progress. Just as an example, if the Palestinian issue were raised
                            first, it could easily hang things up six months or more. Then we would
                            be in the United States in a re-election period. The stage when all
                            these issues have to be discussed will come, but it is not yet here.</p>
                        <p>The most important problem is to avoid backward movement. If we can get
                            Israel to bring about some progress, it would help in this negotiation
                            in an important psychological way. This is why we would like to deal
                            with one issue at a time. This way we can avoid delay even though that
                            is what some Israelis are trying to develop as a tactic.</p>
                        <p>On another question, Syria seems to think that we are trying to split the
                            Arabs. I have great personal affection for Asad. He is a real man but
                            the only way that we can help to make progress on Syria is that we must
                            take a step first with Egypt and once progress is made, then we can move
                            elsewhere. That is our policy.</p>
                        <p>Right now we think that the negotiations can succeed because we have a
                            strong Presidential position. People don't take Secretaries of State
                            seriously but they do take the President seriously and it is his
                            personal intervention with Israel that has enabled us to get
                            propositions from Israel that we feel now meet the basic demands of
                            Sadat for the first time. But there still are an enormous number of <pb
                                n="9" xml:id="d74-09" facs="d74-09"/>details and, of course, the
                            Israelis are not known for their excessive generosity in these matters.
                            But we have established certain principles and we feel that there is a
                            chance to finish by the end of August. Once we can get that kind of
                            agreement then we can turn to the Syrian problem. After that, we can
                            move to an overall solution.</p>
                        <p>On the Israeli side, their strategy is that they are much more
                            comfortable with the radical Arab leaders than with the moderates. If
                            the Arabs are anti-American and pro-Soviet then the Israelis feel that
                            they can appeal to the groups in the United States that are anti-Soviet
                            and that, therefore, they have a better chance of getting their
                            positions accepted.</p>
                        <p>It is very important for you, Mr. President, to influence the Arabs to
                            keep on a moderate course. It is in their own interest to continue a
                            policy of moderation that they have been pursuing. This has already had
                            a beneficial effect on American policy which is now fully engaged in an
                            even-handed way. The objective conditions are not here yet for an
                            overall solution which is what President <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> wants but we must continue the moderate position
                            and curb some of the Arab desire for epic cavalry charges. It is in this
                            sense that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> issue is a major
                            problem. If Israel is suspended, all support will go toward Israel in
                            the United States and the Israelis will come to us and ask--how can we
                            rely on <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces to police a settlement
                            when we are not even in the United Nations. We do think that we do have
                            a chance to make progress and that is what we are trying to do now.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d74-10" facs="d74-10"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: Our Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs Minic will go to Lima. His position will not be easy but he will
                            do what he can. But if one wants to be against something one needs
                            arguments. We are aware of the consequences and we are against having
                            Israel thrown out of the UN. It would be a very unhappy situation. I
                            have great confidence that extreme measures will not be applied. But
                            there are other intermediate measures. We are not against sanctions. You
                            should try to convince Israel because in this matter they are very
                            short-sighted.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: But if I go to the Middle East before the non-aligned
                            meeting in Lima, you can assume that there is a great chance that we are
                            assured of success. Because the President has said to me that I must not
                            go to the Middle East again unless we are 90 percent assured of success.
                            You could be very helpful in convincing the Syrians that we are not
                            interested in splitting the Arabs. We had no contact with the Arab world
                            for ten years. We certainly don't want to move them back toward
                            radicalism. We want them to continue to be moderate. It is in our own
                            self-interest to make them even more moderate and we certainly don't
                            want to isolate either the Syrians or the Algerians and you can help us
                            convince them of that. It is in our own self-interest. We have a very
                            high regard and good relations with Boumediene and these are in fact
                            better relations than might be indicated by our respective public
                            statements. I hope that Mr. Minic will try to convey these views for us.
                            In any case, we will speak directly to the Algerians. If I go to the
                            Middle East, I will try to stop in Algiers. We have good relations with
                            him. He is a strong and thoughtful man.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>: Yes. He is a very good
                            man.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: His trouble on economic issues at any rate is that he
                            cannot take “yes” for an answer.</p>
                        <p>The President: I would like to add in conclusion that we are interested
                            in strengthening the forces of peace and that we know that we must work
                            together to do this. But we cannot do it all. We can't solve the Middle
                            East problem alone. Our cooperation is crucial and we want to have a
                            broadened ability to help the less-developed countries, the nonaligned

                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: Are there any comments
                            from my Ministers?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>: If I may ask a question,
                            what do you, Mr. President, and the Secretary, think will happen if
                            there is no success? You mentioned war but what other ideas apart from
                            your efforts do you have?</p>
                        <p>The President: If we fail in our current efforts we will have to proceed
                            with our reassessment. One possibility is that we will move to Geneva
                            and advocate a broad settlement even though we know that that is a less
                            desirable course of action. But it might temporarily help to avoid a
                            conflict but for the moment we strongly feel that a step-by-step policy
                            is superior.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: That is the reason that we have been reluctant to go to
                            Geneva right away. The Arabs must ask for the <gloss target="#t_PLO1"
                                >PLO</gloss> to be included and that could lead to a deadlock that
                            might last for months. Also, those who know Arabs feel that, with four
                            groups of them in the room, the oratory would not exactly be calm. It
                            would play into the <pb n="12" xml:id="d74-12" facs="d74-12"/>hands of
                            the Israeli strategy for delay. The President would find it difficult to
                            be effective in an election period but we are definitely committed to go
                            to Geneva at some point. It is just a question of timing to use our
                            action to the maximum effect.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: Should present efforts
                            fail, you suggest Geneva. Would you go with the Soviets?</p>
                        <p>The President: The Secretary has had recent talks with <persName
                                corresp="#p_GAA1">Gromyko</persName> on this. He could discuss
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: The basic strategy of the Soviets is to take credit for
                            our actions. But at the right moment, in any case, we will have to go to
                            Geneva. If we fail, we will also have to go to Geneva and then put our
                            ideas forward for an overall settlement. We will not, however, go there
                            as the lawyer for one party.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>: Would the Soviets accept to
                            go if the present efforts fail?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: They would happily go to Geneva. But their capacity to
                            produce anything is very limited. They would go together with us if our
                            efforts fail. Even then, it depends on what we can do with the Israelis.
                            For the President of the United States this is a domestic problem. What
                            we want is permanent peace, withdrawal and guarantees on all fronts.
                            That is our basic position.</p>
                        <p>The President: If we go to Geneva and put a broad proposal forward and
                            then get in a brawl about the <gloss target="#t_PLO1">PLO</gloss>, it
                            could actually lead further toward <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            expulsion. The domestic problems in the United States would become
                            monumental.</p>
                        <pb n="13" xml:id="d74-13" facs="d74-13"/>
                        <p>The Secretary: Beside we have no intention of failing. The President is
                            not as gentle as he appears in his behavior.</p>
                        <p>The President: I show my true nature with my old friends in Congress.
                            Speaking of Congress you have a good delegation coming here with the
                            Speaker of the House. They have great respect for you and Yugoslavia. I
                            think it would be useful for you to have a frank discussion with them
                            and give them your analysis of the Middle East situation. That would be
                            very helpful to us.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: I would be glad to do
                            that.</p>
                        <p>The President: The Speaker is third in line for succession.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: The President is always extremely nervous when he (Albert)
                            moves up (to second place) as has happened two times before.</p>
                        <p>The President: I might say that, back in the times when I used to talk to
                            John Foster Dulles, he told me of the excellent relations we had with
                            Yugoslavia on the question of arms sales. I realize that there may be
                            some people in the bureaucracy who have not given the proper attention
                            and expedited the request that you have made but when I get back I will
                            give this my personal attention and I can assure you that the matter
                            will be resolved.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: We have bureaucrats on
                            both sides. It was very good of you to raise the question because that
                            saved me the trouble of raising it.</p>
                        <p>The President: I can speak very frankly about bureaucrats.</p>
                        <pb n="14" xml:id="d74-14" facs="d74-14"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: I cannot because my Prime
                            Minister is here.</p>
                        <p>KARDELJ: I wonder if I could add a point about the economic situation.
                            Yugoslavia has moved on now from the stage of being a less-developed
                            country. It has great need for capital because it is still developing.
                            We believe that the greatest source of capital can come from the United
                            States. We want to have a larger connection of American capital to our
                            industry. In industry, agriculture, technology, know-how, we would like
                            to get more from the United States. Although our systems differ, we have
                            a system that enables us to use both public and private groups to work
                            to build our country. We are preparing a new law on investment which
                            will make things easier for investors from abroad. But we notice that
                            there is still mistrust in certain American circles. It would be good
                            for the United States Administration to support this effort more to help
                            to create an atmosphere under which trust can be developed in this
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The President: I have been very impressed by what I have seen and I
                            understand that American industry and capital have been very well
                            received here in Yugoslavia and have achieved many successes. This has
                            certainly strengthened our ties. If there are special areas of
                            particular interest on the industrial side, I would be glad to get into
                            this matter, as I have already said I will get into the matter of
                            military hardware.</p>
                        <p>I should add to what I said earlier that the capacity of American
                            industry depends on our own economic strength. We have been <pb n="15"
                                xml:id="d74-15" facs="d74-15"/>in a serious economic recession over
                            the past six to eight months but by firm policies we have started to
                            recover in a constructive way. We are well ahead of other major
                            developed countries in our recovery. But any outside impact, such as an
                            oil embargo, would severely affect our ability to recover from recession
                            and that could set us back six months to a year or longer. We want to
                            expand our relations throughout the world and to do this we need a
                            healthy American economy.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>: If we want to improve the
                            economy, we also need to have better cooperation between developed
                            countries and less-developed countries. That is why we are very
                            interested in the Seventh <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Special
                            Session. We know that the United States will play a key role and indeed
                            the outcome will depend in large part on the position of the United
                            States. If I can ask a question I would like to hear what your attitude
                            is going to be on relations between developed countries and
                            less-developed countries, especially since the United States had
                            reservations about the way the Sixth Session went.</p>
                        <p>We have a very, serious and explosive situation. Thirty to forty
                            less-developed countries are in a catastrophic economic situation.
                            According to the <gloss target="#t_GATT1">GATT</gloss>, there is a 30 to
                            40 billion dollar deficit on the trade account for the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>c. This is a problem that concerns the
                            whole world. We expect to have a harsh debate in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and you will need to have patience. One
                            of the things that concerns me is that, as I understand, there has not
                            even been an agreement yet on the agenda for the meeting.</p>
                        <pb n="16" xml:id="d74-16" facs="d74-16"/>
                        <p>The President: We will go to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            session with a very constructive attitude. The Secretary will go there
                            and indicate our attitude. In the history of the United States in the
                            post war period--during my whole term in the Congress since 1949--we
                            have been sympathetic and we have provided leadership in helping the
                            less-developed countries. We have world-wide relations and bilateral
                            relations. The present crisis is not our fault. It is due to the extreme
                            increase in oil prices. We want to work to avoid a catastrophe. The
                            Secretary will have a constructive attitude. We recognize the realities
                            we find in the world today.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>: It is also fair to say that
                            inflation has played a role in the basic economic problems of our
                            world.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: The basic issue is--are we going to have another
                            ideological confrontation and no practical results? If we defend the
                            existing system and you say the “new economic order” is better, we will
                            accomplish nothing. I have made a tremendous effort and we are telling
                            all of our people to stop defending the economic system.</p>
                        <p>We want to get down to special cases and see whether we can't make
                            progress. We will make specific proposals on energy, raw materials,
                            financing, and development designed to even out the fluctuations in our
                            economic trends. We are not in favor of price stabilization schemes. We
                            are in favor, instead, of income stabilization which would allow a
                            certain amount of price fluctuation to occur. We think that price
                            stabilization schemes would benefit mainly countries like the United
                            States and the <pb n="17" xml:id="d74-17" facs="d74-17"/>Soviet Union
                            who are raw material producers. But income stabilization would help the
                            least developed countries.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>: As far as we know the
                            less-developed countries do not intend to have a philosophical debate on
                            the new economic order. They intend to raise, however, their special
                            problems but I am worried that it is impossible to reach an agreement
                            even on the agenda. The “Seventy-Seven” have put forward the following
                            list of things to be discussed: trade in raw materials; trade in
                            industrial products; monetary problems; technology problems; and changes
                            in the structure of the United Nations to deal with development. Your
                            delegation has added “food” and “the problems of the most seriously
                            affected countries (<gloss target="#t_MSA1">MSA</gloss>).” We have been
                            wondering why there is already a tense atmosphere on the agenda and we
                            hope that you Americans will help to make progress in this session.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary: I have not followed in detail the question of negotiations
                            about the agenda but I can tell you that we will have a constructive
                            attitude. We'll also support the consumer-producer dialogue and we feel
                            that, while the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> session can discuss
                            policy issues, we can get down to specific negotiations in the three or
                            four commissions set up under the Energy Conference. These commissions
                            would be on energy, raw materials, development and finance.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>: I would also like to have
                            a discussion on the relations between the United States and the

                            see how we can establish contact. Maybe you and Mr. <persName

                        <p>The Secretary: That is an excellent idea. We certainly do lack this kind

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1">Kissinger</persName>'s visit to
                            Yugoslavia 4 November 1974 signaled a US Government willingness to
                            establish a closer relationship with Yugoslavia. In view of the Yugoslav
                            desire to include enhancement of military-to-military relations in the
                            overall upgrading, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName> indicated that ASD/ISA <persName
                                corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName> would visit Belgrade in
                            December 1974. During the <persName corresp="#p_ERF1"
                                >Ellsworth</persName> visit, the Yugoslavs were informed that the
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> desired to cooperate with and
                            assist the Yugoslav military in any way possible, consistent with
                            overall <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>/Yugoslav political relations.
                            The key to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assistance was mutually
                            defined as the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> attempting to be
                            responsive to specific Yugoslav expressions of needs and
                            requirements.</p>
                        <p>As a follow-up to the <persName corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName>
                            visit, on 26 February 1975, the Yugoslav Military Attache in Washington
                            forwarded to <gloss target="#t_ASD1">ASD</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName> an initial list of
                            Yugoslav desires. This list, which contained very broad general
                            categories of equipment, as well as some specific items, has received a
                            continuing review to determine, first, what specific items we could
                            immediately offer the Yugoslavs, and second, items which were
                            insufficiently identified or which involved inhibitions because of
                            National Disclosure Policy (<gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss>) or
                            national security implications. As determinations of equipment
                            availability or the need for additional clarification of requirements
                            have been made, these have been communicated to <gloss target="#t_GOY1"
                                >GOY</gloss> through its Military Attache in Washington.
                            Additionally, subsequent to the <persName corresp="#p_ERF1"
                                >Ellsworth</persName> visit, the Yugoslavs have forwarded from time
                            to time requests for individual items, to which we have in due course
                            responded. To date, there has been no reaction from the Yugoslavs to our
                            specific responses to their 26 February letter, either in the area of
                            materiel we have indicated as available to them, or on items for which
                            we needed further clarification.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there have been several successful undertakings to
                            satisfy Yugoslav requests, as well as numerous on-going
                            transactions.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>We have additionally been working to encourage the Yugoslav Military
                            Attache here to facilitate the processing of Yugoslav military equipment
                            requests by developing a closer working relationship with officials in
                            the Pentagon. Likewise, we have, through our Embassy in Belgrade, been
                            encouraging Yugoslav defense officials to conduct more productive
                            liaison with our Defense Attaches there. This has appeared to bear some
                            fruit in the follow-up of Secretary of the Air Force McLucas' visit to
                            Belgrade in June 1975, during which the Yugoslavs promised to provide a
                            more detailed, specific list of Air Force needs. They have been working
                            with our personnel in Belgrade to accomplish this. Another important
                            development was Secretary Schlesinger's recent approval of an exception
                            to the <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> to permit release to
                            Yugoslavia of information on “Organization, Training and Employment of
                            Military Forces” and “Military Materiel and Munitions” through SECRET
                            for visual/oral presentations and through CONFIDENTIAL on a documentary
                            basis. While individual items of equipment will still need to be
                            reviewed by cognizant agencies on a case-by-case basis, the Secretary's
                            finding will do much to establish an enhanced environment of commitment
                            within <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> to be more forthcoming in
                            attempts to provide military assistance to Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>While a fully responsive relationship has been slow to develop, because
                            of hesitant reaction within both the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            and Yugoslav military organizations, the momentum is accelerating. (The
                            above mentioned <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> cases, except for
                            the 8” ammo, have all originated subsequent to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName> visit.) The most important
                            aspect of building the relationship is establishing a feeling <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="d75-03" facs="d75-03"/>of understanding and confidence in
                            mutual relations at all levels of both the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and Yugoslav bureaucracies. As more <gloss
                                target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss> cases are processed, and more visit
                            exchanges take place, <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>/Yugoslav
                            military relations are increasingly settling into a desirable routine.
                            Persistence and energetic follow-through are needed on both sides. We
                            are striving for a steady-state relationship, with both bureaucracies
                            geared to carry on routine activities regardless of the vicissitudes of
                            temporary, fluctuating political attitudes, recognizing, however, that
                            military-to-military relations can only exist within the context of
                            overall political relations between the two countries. We will continue
                            to work toward establishing a base of cooperation (particularly in the
                            materiel/training/equipment arena) in relatively non-controversial
                            areas, as we increasingly attack and resolve more difficult areas
                            involving technology-transfer and state-of-the-art-equipment, which is
                            of particular interest to Yugoslavia. (The <gloss target="#t_NDP1"
                                >NDP</gloss> exception will permit valuable dialogue heretofore not
                            possible in exploring these problems.) We will continue to emphasize to
                            the Yugoslavs the necessity clearly to define what they want from us
                            since we have great difficulty responding to broadly generalized
                            categories of equipment. In consonance with Amembassy Belgrade
                            suggestions, we will pursue an expanded program of individual and team
                            visit exchanges, particularly Yugoslav personnel visits to the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> (including training activities,
                            laboratories/testing facilities, and industrial activities), as this
                            should provide the Yugoslavs a better-technical background from which to
                            define their needs in familiar terms.</p>
                        <p>The initial steps, over the last seven months, in re-establishing a
                            viable military-to-military relationship, have been the most difficult.
                            However, the future augurs well, having received an important boost from
                            the <persName corresp="#p_FGR1">Ford</persName>/<persName

                            Yugoslavia. The experience we have gained thus far in working with each
                            other gives us a good base for further cooperation and a more
                            satisfactory <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> response to expressed
                            Yugoslav requirements.</p>

                        <p>This paper gives the false impression that we have treated Yugoslav
                            requests for assistance and cooperation in an orderly and forthcoming
                            manner. In fact, as Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SLH1"
                                >Silberman</persName> has pointed out, there has been considerable
                            resistance to this by the Armed Services. <gloss target="#t_ISA1"
                                >ISA</gloss> has been doing what it can to clarify Yugoslav requests
                            and urge favorable action. However, as of now, no classified material
                            has been approved for sale and only token amounts of unclassified
                            material has been offered to the Yugoslavs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SJR1">Schlesinger</persName>'s decision
                            of August 22 to grant an exception to our National Disclosure Policy for
                            Yugoslavia may represent a key breakthrough in this situation. However,
                            the Services will still have action responsibility and it is clear that
                            a firm political hand will be needed to ensure that the previous inertia
                            is overcome.</p>
                        <p>Thus, the major problem is to break the log jam. In doing this, however,
                            we must be sure not to be carried away in the opposite direction of
                            simply giving the Yugoslavs a blank check for anything them want. Our
                            policy must be set in a political framework. The key factor is that the
                            military is likely to play a crucial role in Yugoslavia after Tito.
                            Aside from the party structure, it is the only all Yugoslav organization
                            in the country and as such constitutes a vital unifying force. Our
                            political objectives are thus: <pb n="2" xml:id="d76-02" facs="d76-02"/>
                            <list>
                                <item>-- To increase our influence among the Yugoslav military and
                                    correspondingly to reduce in relative terms the preponderant
                                    Soviet influence gained as a result of being chief military
                                    supplier for the past 15 years.</item>
                                <item>-- To enhance the Yugoslav military ability to resist any
                                    Soviet encroachment which might occur during a period of
                                        post-<persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
                                    instability.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SLH1">Silberman</persName> has recently
                            proposed a number of measures in the field of exchanges and cooperation.
                            A positive action on these recommendations would be directly responsive
                            to our first political objective as noted above. (See Tab A)</p>
                        <p>Responsiveness to Yugoslav request for actual hardware is designed to
                            meet the second objective. A good example of the kind of system ideally
                            suited to this purpose is the <gloss target="#t_TOW1">TOW</gloss>
                            anti-tank missile system which was included in the original Yugoslav
                            shopping list of February 26, 1975. This is a classified system and is
                            not available in large quantities. However, its sale in at least token
                            quantities is under active consideration and hopefully will be approved
                            without delay.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the political factors cited above, there are other
                            political aspects which should be factored into the decisions on
                            specific requests as they are made. For example, the Yugoslavs have
                            asked for Napalm--provision of which would have obvious negative
                            political ramifications for us domestically. We must also gauge our
                            responses with an eye to Yugoslav political behavior toward us. For
                            example, while the Yugoslavs were not unhelpful in the Committee of 24
                            on the Puerto Rican issue, Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM9"
                                >Minic</persName>'s August 26 speech at the Lima Nonaligned Nations
                            Conference was somewhat intemperate on matters of interest to us. While
                            a certain tolerance of the Yugoslavs is required at times, and we must
                            be careful to avoid knee-jerk reactions, we must continue to make clear
                            to them that our military relations cannot take place in a political
                            vacuum, as was shown by our standdown on military sales in October 1973
                            because of Yugoslavia's aid to the Soviets in resupplying the Arabs.</p>
                        <p>On the domestic political side, it should be noted that Congressmen
                            Zablocki and Price, during a recent visit to <pb n="3" xml:id="d76-03"
                                facs="d76-03"/>Belgrade, were sympathetic to the sale of military
                            equipment to Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>In sum, the present situation is that we have received voluminous
                            Yugoslav requests on which <gloss target="#t_ISA1">ISA</gloss> is
                            seeking greater specificity. Despite the August 22 decision on <gloss
                                target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss>, a major effort is needed to get <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> moving. This movement, however, when
                            achieved must be carefully calibrated to our political objectives in
                            Yugoslavia.</p>

                            Yugoslavia is provided in response to your request.</p>
                        <p>(C) When <gloss target="#t_ASD1">ASD</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_ERF1">Ellsworth</persName> visited Belgrade in
                            December 74, it was made clear to the Yugoslavs that the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> was committed to assisting and
                            cooperating with the Yugoslav military in an attempt to upgrade our
                            military-to-military relations. Such assistance was to include sales of
                            military equipment to Yugoslavia, subject to the understanding that we
                            might not be able to provide everything the Yugoslavs might want,
                            inasmuch as there were some items of equipment we didn't even provide
                            our closest allies. It was determined, therefore, that the Yugoslavs
                            would provide to us lists of equipment they desired, which we would then
                            review in order to determine our capability to be responsive. Internally
                            in <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DoD</gloss>, in pursuit of our policy to be
                            as forthcoming as possible, we have attempted first to identify
                            relatively uncontroversial items which we could sell to the Yugoslavs,
                            thus allowing us to build up a base of experience in working with each
                            other. There has been no particular timetable for responding to the
                            Yugoslav requests, since we have attempted to respond on a continuing
                            basis as items available to them were identified. There have been
                            numerous such responses, many of which await a Yugoslav reaction to
                            actually initiate a Foreign Military Sales (<gloss target="#t_FMS1"
                                >FMS</gloss>) case. In a corollary vein, because of their
                            generalized descriptions of materiel, there frequently has been
                            difficulty in defining exactly what it is the Yugoslavs desire. Requests
                            to the Military Attache for clarification also remain unanswered. Thus
                            far there has been relatively little materiel actually provided the
                            Yugoslavs, such materiel being essentially in the area of spare/repair
                            parts.</p>
                        <p>(C) Coincident with efforts to review and determine availability of
                            requested equipment, a joint State/OSD initiative was made to acquire an
                            exception to the National Disclosure Policy (<gloss target="#t_NDP1"
                                >NDP</gloss>) to permit a dialogue with the Yugoslavs in classified
                            matters. The intent of this action was to get <pb n="2" xml:id="d77-02"
                                facs="d77-02"/>approval to provide Yugoslavia with information on
                            “Organization, Training and Employment of Military Forces” and “Military
                            Materiel and Munitions” through SECRET for visual/oral presentations and
                            through CONFIDENTIAL on a documentary basis. The release of individual
                            items of classified equipment will still have to be reviewed by
                            cognizant agencies on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                        <p>(C) Over the long term we hope to move from provision to the Yugoslavs of
                            uncontroversial items to consideration of more sophisticated and modern
                            equipments. This presupposes the possibility of providing the Yugoslavs
                            with certain advanced technology, while not necessarily always releasing
                            state-of-the-art technology. It is in this area that there is great
                            hesitancy in being forthcoming with the Yugoslavs, particularly on the
                            part of the military services, primarily because of concern that such
                            advanced technology would somehow leak to the Soviets/Warsaw Pact.
                            Moreover, this really gets to the heart of the matter, because we
                            believe that, while the Yugoslavs genuinely want materiel support for
                            older equipment, what they seek foremost is to modernize and provide
                            their forces with the most advanced equipment they can obtain. Our
                            reticence thus far in this area of endeavor has doubtless been apparent,
                            and has led to considerable impatience on their part.</p>
                        <p>(C) With the approval by the Secretary of Defense on 22 August of the
                            requested <gloss target="#t_NDP1">NDP</gloss> exception, we hope we have
                            set the stage for encouraging the Services to deal more flexibly with
                            the provision of some sophisticated equipment to Yugoslavia. One of our
                            first targets in this regard will be to provide the TOW anti-tank
                            weapon, inasmuch as that is a demonstrably desirable defensive weapon
                            for the Yugoslavs vis-a-vis the large Soviet tank threat. Further, we
                            know the <gloss target="#t_TOW1">TOW</gloss> was captured by the North
                            Vietnamese late in the Vietnam War; thus it is assumed already to have
                            been compromised to the Soviets. As an additional effort, in consonance
                            with recommendations of our Ambassador in Belgrade, we intend to
                            intensify our program of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>/Yugoslav
                            military visits and exchanges, since we have seen clearly that personal
                            involvement is invaluable in obtaining specificity and definition of
                            what the Yugoslavs want, as well as in orienting <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> personnel toward being more responsive to Yugoslav
                            requests for assistance.</p>
                        <p>(U) Itemized lists of Yugoslav requests, with our reactions thereto,
                            including instances where we have responded positively by providing
                            requested information and/or equipment, are attached.</p>

                        <p>Your memorandum of September 6, 1975 (I-9463/75) providing a status
                            report on U.S. supply of military equipment to Yugoslavia is
                            appreciated. Judging from your report, while there have been initial
                            contacts with the Yugoslav Government on the possible sale of a number
                            of items of U. S. military equipment, approved sales and contracts have
                            been limited by: the need for responses to U.S. offers from the
                            Yugoslavs, the need for further clarification on items being proposed by
                            the Yugoslavs, and the need for National Disclosure Policy exceptions on
                            specific items of equipment.</p>
                        <p>You are aware of the President's keen interest in insuring a cooperative
                            response to the Yugoslav requests for military equipment. Pursuant to
                            that interest, the President has asked that the Department of Defense,
                            in coordination with the Department of State, give careful attention to
                            Yugoslav requests for U.S. military equipment, obtaining responses where
                            U.S. offers have been made, obtaining clarifications when required by
                            the United States, and insuring that the review process for specific
                            items of requested equipment is handled expeditiously so as to insure
                            prompt approval of all appropriate sales.</p>

                        <p>(U) This responds to your request of 22 September for a further report on
                            the status of the sale of military equipment to Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>(C) Good progress has been made since our last status report to you on
                            this subject. A significant step has been <gloss target="#t_DOD1"
                                >DoD</gloss> and State agreement to make the <gloss target="#t_TOW1"
                                >TOW</gloss> anti-tank weapon system available to the Yugoslavs.
                            However, the Yugoslavs have not yet been informed because of lack of
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> agreement on when delivery could
                            be made. This Department has proposed to tell them that <gloss
                                target="#t_TOW1">TOW</gloss> is available from normal production
                            after an order is placed in accordance with <gloss target="#t_FMS1"
                                >FMS</gloss> procedures. (Given <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>
                            force needs and other approved <gloss target="#t_FMS1">FMS</gloss>
                            cases, this would permit delivery to the Yugoslavs beginning in about
                            two years.) State believes we need to give the Yugoslavs more tangible
                            evidence of our good faith. They propose that we provide a nominal
                            number of <gloss target="#t_TOW1">TOW</gloss> systems for training and
                            familiarization in the immediate future, with the balance to follow from
                            production. For the reasons cited above, primarily the need for
                            rebuilding the TOW inventory for our own forces, DoD has not agreed to
                            this procedure. Notification to Yugoslavia of <gloss target="#t_TOW1"
                                >TOW</gloss> availability awaits resolution of this matter.</p>
                        <p>(C) With regard to the list of items presented to then Secretary of the
                            Air Force McLucas on 1 August, we have made excellent progress. The
                            Acting Secretary of the Air Force has just forwarded a letter to the
                            Yugoslav Air Force Commander, informing him that the majority (over 60%)
                            of the items listed are available to Yugoslavia. As requested, General
                            Cemalovic has been given the names and addresses of possible commercial
                            suppliers of the approved items. Once they have studied our response and
                            refined their requirements, the Yugoslavs presumably will undertake to
                            satisfy their needs through commercial enterprises. Should they,
                            however, elect to pursue purchase of the items through FMS procedures,
                            we will be prepared expeditiously to process such requests. (An update
                            of the detailed 1 August list, provided as attachment (2) to my 6
                            September memorandum, is attached hereto.)</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d79-02" facs="d79-02"/>
                        <p>(C) I believe these steps are responsive to the President's desire to
                            move forward with appropriate sales to Yugoslavia. Approval of the
                                <gloss target="#t_TOW1">TOW</gloss> system should be a large plus in
                            our bilateral relations because of <gloss target="#t_TOW1">TOW</gloss>'s
                            high visibility as a first line weapon system. Approval of a large
                            number of items on the 1 August list should also be well received by the
                            Yugoslavs, particularly the availability to them of modern helicopters,
                            numerous radars and sophisticated command and control equipment. DoD
                            representatives have been in touch with the Yugoslav Military Attache in
                            Washington, and U.S. Embassy personnel in Belgrade have been in touch
                            with officials there, with regard to obtaining Yugoslav responses where
                            we have already made offers or asked for clarification. We have tried to
                            impress upon Yugoslav officials that there must be two-way
                            communications if we are to establish a meaningful and productive
                            dialogue. In the case of requested items which we still do not favor
                            making available to Yugoslavia, because of concern for the state of
                            technology involved and security considerations, we will keep such items
                            under continuing review for possible future approval.</p>
                        <p>(C) The most salutary factor in our developing relationship is that we
                            are becoming acclimated to giving serious and sympathetic consideration
                            to Yugoslav requests, whereas a year ago we had virtually no dealings
                            with them. Thus, despite some continuing difficulties on both sides, we
                            are confident that progress will continue as both the <gloss

                        <p>Yugoslav Contingency Study</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_EUCOM1">EUCOM</gloss> contingency papers provide a
                            limited analysis of possible <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and
                            Allied responses to Soviet moves against Yugoslavia. There are a number
                            of conceptual gaps and questionable assumptions, and the presentation of
                            Soviet objectives and possible Western actions is incomplete. A precis
                            of the study, and our comments on major questions, follow. (You should
                            know, parenthetically, that a cleared interagency contingency study on
                            Yugoslavia was completed August 28, 1975, and is awaiting <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> consideration. This State-initiated
                            study focuses on the possibility of domestic disintegration in post-Tito
                            Yugoslavia, without external pressure, and then moves on to
                            contingencies involving various forms of outside interference.)</p>

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_EUCOM1">EUCOM</gloss> study assumes that a major
                            objective of Soviet policy will be to bring post-Tito Yugoslavia under
                            its control, and that the Soviets will be prepared to apply pressure
                            and/or intervene as necessary to accomplish this. The scenarios
                            considered include: <list>

                        </p>
                        <p>For each of these contingencies, the study sketches a range of possible
                                <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> and Allied responses, designed to
                            deter the Soviets from escalating their pressure or intervention at any
                            stage. Beginning with internal Alliance consultations and public
                            statements of support for Yugoslav independence, these options run
                            through limited economic and military equipment support, assistance for
                            unconventional warfare, possible logistic and air support, naval
                            demonstrations, return of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-dual based
                            air and ground forces to Europe, the occupation of all or part of
                            Austria by the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>, and preparations for general
                            European war. The relative advantages and disadvantages of each action
                            are discussed in broad outline.</p>
                        <p>The study assumes that the Yugoslav Army would strongly resist a Soviet
                            invasion, but would rapidly lose control of the major population
                            centers. The campaign would then shift to unconventional warfare in the
                            mountainous areas, under Yugoslavia's nation-in-arms concept, which
                            would provide opportunities for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or
                            Allied assistance to Yugoslav forces, but would not involve introduction
                            of major <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or Allied combat forces. In
                            the event of a Soviet invasion, the study assumes that Hungary and
                            Bulgaria would agree to participate and contribute forces, but that
                            Romania probably would not participate.</p>

                        <p>Soviet Objectives</p>
                        <p>We accept the paper's assumption that the Soviets have the long-term
                            objective of bringing Yugoslavia back into their orbit. But we believe
                            the paper over-emphasizes the probability of Soviet military
                            intervention and underplays the possibilities for Soviet activities
                            short of a major invasion.</p>
                        <p>In a number of places the study suggests an analogy with Czechoslovakia
                            in 1968 or Hungary in 1956. However, the Yugoslav case differs in that,
                            unlike Czechoslovakia and Hungary, Yugoslavia has not been under Soviet
                            control.</p>
                        <p>Internal developments in Yugoslavia would be unlikely to pose a direct
                            threat to the Soviet security system and a wide variety of Yugoslav
                            succession outcomes would be acceptable or tolerable to Moscow. Also,
                            the Soviets would have to calculate that the <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> might move to
                            counter a thrust against Yugoslavia.</p>
                        <p>Soviet intervention in Yugoslavia would thus be a response to a perceived
                            opportunity--rather than a defensive move to preserve the status quo as
                            in the Czech and Hungarian crises. Intervention may be envisaged in a
                            situation of internal disarray or conflict associated with the
                                post-<persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> transition.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances: <list>
                                <item>-- the most probable manner of Soviet intervention would be
                                    limited assistance (materiel, technicians, “volunteers”) to a
                                    party to internal strife in Yugoslavia.</item>
                                <item>-- the possibilities for deterring Soviet intervention are
                                    good, since the Soviets would probably not be faced with a
                                    threat to their major strategic interests.</item>

                                        >Tito</persName> Yugoslavia will probably be relatively
                                    slow, giving the West time to react to possible Soviet
                                    troublemaking.</item>

                        <p>Western Options</p>
                        <p>We agree with the paper's basic approach of seeking to deter Soviet
                            action through carefully tailored diplomatic and military moves. There
                            are, however, a number of gaps in the consideration of possible Western
                            options.</p>
                        <p>We need to consider means to make clear to the Soviets the price they
                            would pay in their relations with us, the West Europeans, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_LDC1">LDC</gloss>'s, if they moved to infringe Yugoslav
                            sovereignty. We should develop a more comprehensive checklist of
                            concrete steps which could be taken. This would include also
                            consideration of Yugoslavia's economic ties with West Europe; and the
                            situation of Yugoslav workers in Germany.</p>
                        <p>Discussion of <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or Allied actions for
                            support of unconventional warfare is well handled. We agree that this is
                            the most likely contingency in the unlikely event the Yugoslav situation
                            deteriorates.</p>
                        <p>There is no treatment of possible <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> or
                            Allied options which could meet a major Soviet invasion. There should be
                            some military analysis done of such contingencies ranging from air
                            support to small unit operations to large scale counter invasion. The
                            results of such analysis would be relevant in the event that support for
                            unconventional warfare proved inadequate to resist a Soviet takeover. We
                            would then be forced to reassess our role and objectives, and to decide
                            whether Western interests in Yugoslav neutrality would warrant the
                            political and military risks of major combat in Yugoslavia itself or
                            general war in the event of large-scale Soviet intervention. Without
                            serious contingency plans for the potential employment of forces in
                            Yugoslavia, any maneuvering or shows of force would be easily seen as a
                            bluff.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d82-05" facs="d82-05"/>
                        <p>An adequate analysis should consider in some detail the potential and
                            risks of operations through Trieste, through Thessaloniki, and across
                            the Adriatic, as well as possible air and naval support roles.</p>
                        <p>The only major Western military operation discussed in the study is the
                            plan for the joint <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-<gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> occupation of Austria. This is designed
                            to link the Italian and central fronts, and appears to be intended to
                            provide the Allies with a bargaining chip with the Soviets and to be
                            related more to a general war contingency. Without planning for
                            operations beyond Austria into Yugoslavia itself, it would have little
                            relevance to the situation in Yugoslavia. Moreover, it would be very
                            divisive within <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>. In the event, the
                            Soviets might use Western occupation of Western Austria as an excuse for
                            their occupation of Eastern Austria.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_EUCOM1">EUCOM</gloss> paper contains little
                            analysis of the views of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Allies,
                            which would be crucial in any possible Yugoslav contingency. A fuller
                            analysis would have to cover some of the following points: <list>
                                <item>-- Although the Allies have long recognized that a change in
                                    Yugoslavia's orientation would have a major impact on Western
                                    security and perceptions of the balance of power, they have been
                                    unclear and hesitant in considering what might be done to
                                    prevent such a shift. In the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of
                                    Czechoslovakia, the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                                    Foreign Ministers made a veiled reference to Yugoslavia (and
                                    Romania) in a communique, stating that “any Soviet intervention
                                    directly or indirectly affecting the situation in Europe or in
                                    the Mediterranean would create an international crisis with
                                    grave consequences.” However, consultations on contingency
                                    planning lapsed as memories of 1968 receded into the
                                    past.</item>

                                    likelihood and strength of Yugoslav resistance to Soviet
                                    pressure/intervention, or on the possibility that any conflict
                                    could be confined to Yugoslavia. There would be less chance of
                                    gaining Allied support if Yugoslavia appeared likely to collapse
                                    quickly, or if Allied intervention promised a serious risk of
                                    broader war.</item>

                            have to be taken into account.</p>

                            <item>-- In the Italian case, the <gloss target="#t_EUCOM1"
                                    >EUCOM</gloss> paper appears to assume that Italian facilities
                                would be available to the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> at will.
                                We believe that, in practice, Italian reactions and willingness to
                                become involved or allow <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> use of
                                facilities in Italy will vary greatly depending on internal Italian
                                developments (including governmental weakness, the strength and
                                potentially ambiguous position of the <gloss target="#t_PCI1"
                                    >PCI</gloss>) and the situation in Yugoslavia, including the
                                degree to which Soviet pressures on Yugoslavia seemed to directly
                                threaten Italy.</item>
                            <item>-- The Greek reaction, which is not analyzed, could be affected by
                                Greece's present delicate relationship with <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                    >NATO</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>,
                                traditional Greek interests in the Balkans--e.g., the continued
                                Greek interest in promoting a “Balkan dialogue"--and concerns about
                                the effect of possible involvement on its difficulties with Turkey.
                                Similarly, the Turkish attitudes would reflect not only the threat
                                of changes in the Balkans, but also the uncertainties of <gloss
                                    target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Turkish negotiations, and the
                                potential Turkish reassessment of its relationship with <gloss

                        <p>The Eastern Europeans</p>
                        <p>The study assumes that the East Europeans, with the probable exception of
                            Romania, will be reliable Soviet allies for moves against Yugoslavia. If
                            faced with demonstrations of <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>'s
                            resolve in Central Europe, one or more of them (Hungary, for example)
                            might well see an invasion of Yugoslavia as a reckless gamble. Their
                            reliability must therefore remain in doubt. Moreover, the Romanians can
                            hardly be expected to watch fellow “maverick” Yugoslavia succumb to
                            Soviet tanks without seeing the implications for themselves. At the
                            minimum, we see the uncertainty of the Romanian reaction as a
                            complicating factor in Soviet planning. Also, we cannot agree that once
                            Yugoslavia is taken Romania would be successfully pressured to return to
                            good standing in the Socialist camp. While the Soviets may be expected
                            to exert considerable pressure on Romania, and perhaps secure some
                            temporary concessions from Bucharest the present Romanian leadership is
                            likely to continue pursuing its maverick foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>Finally, Albania will watch Soviet moves directed against Yugoslavia with
                            immense anxiety and is likely to call upon the PRC for moral and
                            military support, which could raise questions of the PRC reaction.</p>
                        <p>Conclusion:</p>
                        <p>In sum, as indicated by the above questions, we believe that the <gloss
                                target="#t_EUCOM1">EUCOM</gloss> contingency study requires
                            considerably more analysis of both military and political questions
                            before it can be of real assistance in policy planning with regard to
                            Yugoslavia.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>After more than four years of relative stability, the Yugoslav hierarchy
                            is starting to show signs of internal divisions. This activity, which is
                            tied to an overdue “rotation” of leaders next year, provides an
                            opportunity for the current leaders to test their power. Sometime around
                            the turn of the year, the power struggle could come to a head. The
                            players involved are top-ranking party and government figures who will
                            fight to retain influence in the post-<persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> period. In addition, there is reason to believe
                            that Moscow is trying in small ways to reshape the political balance in
                            its favor.</p>
                        <p>The Issues</p>
                        <p>The invisible parts of the Yugoslav political structure permit only a
                            tentative assessment of the questions involved in the power squabbles.
                            From what we know, however, the strains involve three key issues: <list>
                                <item>--The most important and pervasive element is the
                                    decision-making process itself -- who is making or should make
                                    decisions.</item>
                                <item>--Another dominant domestic question is the extent to which
                                    police-state powers, with their attendant excesses, are becoming
                                    a problem.</item>
                                <item>--In foreign policy, the debate centers on the extent to which
                                        <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s ideological
                                    commitments should take precedence over broader national
                                    security interests.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d83-02" facs="d83-02"/>
                        <p>Leadership Disarray</p>
                        <p>There was no question of ultimate authority in Yugoslavia as long a
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> remained in good
                            health. His physical and psychological deterioration in recent years and
                            the piecemeal distribution of his authority to subordinates have,
                            however, clouded lines of authority. The impression is left of that
                            decisions are frequently made on the spot, are often contradictory, and
                            largely shaped by clashes between competing narrow interests.</p>
                        <p>Part of this arises from the fact that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName>'s traditional style of rule has not been modified
                            as his vitality has declined. He has characteristically invested trusted
                            subordinates with power and has personally intervened only when his
                            authority was either needed to resolve an issue or was being
                            questioned.</p>
                        <p>The main elements of this ruling style continue, but without <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s active participation as he has
                            drastically reduced his work schedule and is concentrating on his role
                            as a world statesman.</p>
                        <p>Where The Action Is</p>
                        <p>The conflicts in the hierarchy involve men to whom <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> has delegated specific functional
                            duties and <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Stane Dolanc</persName>, the man
                            who has assumed the responsibility for blending their actions into a
                            coherent national policy. <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>
                            is the senior secretary of the party executive committee and de facto
                            deputy to <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> in the party. He
                            has tried to take up the slack left by <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName>'s growing incapacitation but lacks the power to
                            force his will on the others.</p>
                        <p>In June, Dolanc reportedly took the unusual step of criticizing General
                            Franjo Herljevic, the interior minister, at a meeting of the collective
                            state presidency. Herljevic received the interior portfolio in 1974,
                            when <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> ordered an upgrading
                            of the internal security mechanism. <persName corresp="#p_DS3"
                                >Dolanc</persName> complained that excessive zeal by the police
                            under Herljevic was causing problems at home and hurting Yugoslavia's
                            image abroad. <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>'s complaints
                            apparently fell on deaf ears because subsequent reports indicate that
                            the ministry continues to go its own way.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> has similarly criticized --
                            in private -- Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM9"
                                >Minic</persName>, who has been inclined to recommend actions that
                            would needlessly worsen <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-Yugoslav
                            relations. According to another report, <persName corresp="#p_DS3"
                                >Dolanc</persName> has recently assumed personal responsibility for
                            all foreign policy briefings for the state collective <pb n="3"
                                xml:id="d83-03" facs="d83-03"/>presidency. This may well be an
                            attempt by <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> to extend his
                            influence into the state executive, even though by statute he is
                            forbidden any state post.</p>
                        <p>The ambitious party secretary is also wooing junior generals in a
                            reported effort to undercut Defense Minister Ljubicic, who like
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName> and Herljevic, is a
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> appointee. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>'s pitch to Ljubicic's
                            subordinates is reportedly based on the promise of a more active effort
                            to obtain sophisticated Western arms. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName>, through Ljubicic, blocked a proposed deal last
                            spring for <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> anti-tank weaponry, and the
                            decision does not sit well with the military.</p>

                            Plans</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>'s increasingly aggressive
                            expansion of his influence has predictably met opposition. His sharpest
                            critic is Jure Bilic, a member of the party executive committee. Bilic
                            has reportedly complained directly to <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> about <persName corresp="#p_DS3"
                            >Dolanc</persName>'s unseemly ambition and has told friends that he is
                            trying to accumulate evidence against <persName corresp="#p_DS3"
                                >Dolanc</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The antipathy toward <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> has
                            also taken more complicated forms. The leadership has been studying a
                            plan to tighten policy-making power in the party hierarchy, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> s rivals have seized
                            this opportunity to try to undercut his power base in the executive
                            committee.</p>
                        <p>Under a new scheme, the unwieldy and ineffective party presidium now

                            elsewhere in the regime, would give way to a smaller group. The new body
                            would make and oversee policy and in the process relegate <persName
                                corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>'s executive committee to a lesser
                            role. One of the ploys used by <persName corresp="#p_DS3"
                                >Dolanc</persName>'s rivals has been to try to boost Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName> to head the new
                            organ and to push for <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>'s
                            reassignment to a lesser post.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> at first reportedly
                            responded to this maneuver by arguing that the reorganization should be
                            postponed until the next party congress in 1978. He had powerful support
                            from Edvard Kardelj, a close <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> confidant and an opponent of excessive
                            centralization of authority in Belgrade. We believe that Dolanc received
                            help from representatives of special interests who also dislike
                            concentrated executive authority in the capital.</p>
                        <pb n="4" xml:id="d83-04" facs="d83-04"/>
                        <p>This tactic apparently failed, presumably because <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> was persuaded that the current
                            presidium was simply not effective. (There was one interesting report
                            that claimed Brezhnev used his meeting with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> at the European Communist Party Conference in June
                            to nudge the Yugoslav leader toward tightening the Yugoslav party
                            leadership).</p>
                        <p>The latest information on the proposed change suggests that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> and his supporters have switched
                            their tactics and are now trying to pack the new party organ. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> would like the size of the body
                            to be fairly large around 16 members, with the core of the group
                            consisting of the eight members of the state collective presidency. The
                            remaining members of the “coordination and political council” -- as it
                            is tentatively named -- would represent the six republics. Tito on the
                            other hand is holding out for a much smaller body (6 members) made up of
                            his close cronies plus <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets</p>
                        <p>We suspect that the Soviets have sought to exploit the squabbles to shape
                            the post-<persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> leadership along
                            lines more to their liking. Such efforts could be highly advantageous
                            and attractive if they resulted in gains such as greater Soviet access
                            to Yugoslav naval bases on the Adriatic.</p>
                        <p>Moscow's record in dealing with <persName corresp="#p_DS3"
                                >Dolanc</persName> strongly suggests that the Soviets might
                            favorably consider a curtailment of his political power. Dolanc has been
                            particularly tough on the question of Soviet support for “healthy
                            forces” -- pro-Soviets -- in Yugoslavia. Moscow has in turn indicated
                            its distaste for <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> and its
                            preference to deal directly with <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName>, thereby ignoring <persName corresp="#p_DS3"
                                >Dolanc</persName>'s status as the party's second-in-command.</p>
                        <p>This tactic, however, has served only to alert <persName corresp="#p_DS3"
                                >Dolanc</persName> and the other Yugoslav leaders to Soviet
                            intentions. Moreover, <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>'s
                            readiness to talk tough to the Soviets and the Soviets' demonstrated
                            aversion for him may have increased his stature in the leadership.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets also during their party congress last March pointed up
                                <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>'s lack of experience.
                            The Kremlin invited <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> to an
                            informal gathering at the opera and later billed the conclave as a
                            meeting of representatives from fraternal parties. The ensuing
                            embarrassment was short-lived, but the impression on <persName
                                corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> was not. In June, for example, he
                            reportedly <pb n="5" xml:id="d83-05" facs="d83-05"/>disagreed with
                                <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s decision to attend
                            the European Communist Party Conference in East Berlin, probably out of
                            a belief that the Soviets would once again convey the impression of a
                            Yugoslav return to the fold.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_BLI1">Brezhnev</persName>'s recent visit to
                            Yugoslavia provided new opportunities to influence <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> and others against <persName
                                corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>. Several sources indicate that
                            the Soviets were visibly unhappy that <persName corresp="#p_DS3"
                                >Dolanc</persName> -- and not <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> -- met <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> at the Belgrade airport.</p>
                        <p>The Soviets, however, must be careful not to overplay their hand or else
                            they may inadvertently strengthen <persName corresp="#p_DS3"
                                >Dolanc</persName>'s position. The prospect that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> will play a leading role in the
                                post-<persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> era should also
                            recommend a cautious Soviet tack.</p>
                        <p>The Testing Time</p>
                        <p>The Yugoslav leadership has been fairly stable since the purges in
                            1972-73. More than three years of political stability in Yugoslav
                            practice is highly unusual. The party currently numbers nearly 1.4
                            million members. Yet there are approximately 700,000 ex-members -- that
                            is, people who since 1960 have lost or turned in their party cards.</p>
                        <p>When the Yugoslav leadership is reshuffled next year, the changes will be
                            billed as a personnel “rotation” -- a euphemism used by Belgrade for the
                            regular transfer of portfolios to prevent the development of
                            bureaucratic fiefdoms. The political artillery is now being drawn up for
                            duels over the allocation of good jobs to henchmen and exiling political
                            enemies in remote posts.</p>
                        <p>As with everything else in Yugoslavia, the task will be considerably
                            complicated by the complex mixture of nationalities in the country. By
                            tradition and out of hard political reality, the regime has evolved a
                            system of proportional representation that loosely assures all ethnic
                            groups a roll in Belgrade. With eight major nationalities and subsidiary
                            regional ethnic groups to take into account, the process is extremely
                            complex. Furthermore, the political impact of personnel changes is not
                            always immediately evident. This reflects another aspect of the Yugoslav
                            political scene -- principals in power struggles usually are not
                            humiliated. They instead merely lose influence and tend to fade slowly
                            from the scene.</p>
                        <pb n="6" xml:id="d83-06" facs="d83-06"/>
                        <p>Both Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName> and
                            Defense Minister Ljubicic are widely rumored to be candidates for new
                            jobs. <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>, so the rumors go, may
                            become premier and thus be placed in the wearying and thankless position
                            of overseeing the economy -- the primary role for the head of
                            government. The job has traditionally been a poor platform for anyone
                            with higher party aspirations.</p>
                        <p>Other rumors assert that Defense Minister Ljubicic is destined to take
                            over new duties, perhaps as a leader in the Serb republic. As in
                                <persName corresp="#p_MM9">Minic</persName>'s case, Ljubicic will be
                            removed from an important functional role for broader responsibilities
                            outside of his normal realm of experience and away from his base of
                            power. In addition, the Serbian political scene is in such disarray that
                            it offers the next appointed leader more a headache than a career
                            advancement.</p>
                        <p>Interior Minister Herljevic may survive the thrusts made against him by
                                <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>. Following a recent
                            private meeting between Tito and Herljevic, press releases indicated
                            that <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> unequivocally endorsed
                            the minister. To prevent this action from being read as a rebuke to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>, however, <persName
                                corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName> subsequently took <persName
                                corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> with him on a well-publicized
                            tour of Bosnia-Hercegovina. <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>
                            was also prominent in meetings with <persName corresp="#p_BLI1"
                                >Brezhnev</persName> and at a recent joint session of
                            parliament.</p>
                        <p>Prospects and Variables</p>
                        <p>The rivalry between <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s
                            subordinates will intensify as the time for final personnel decisions
                            nears. The current balance of forces appears generally favorable to
                                <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>, and we expect him to
                            emerge with a clearer mandate for enforcing his will in the overall
                            direction of policy.</p>
                        <p>There are, however, several variables that could undo him. The pivotal
                            factor is likely to be <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>
                            himself. His personal reaction to the squabbling in the leadership
                            currently appears to be to let the contest run its course. He can
                            thereby influence the selection of a first-among-equals without
                            appearing to force his own wishes on those who survive him. There are,
                            however, limits to his restraint. <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> is not likely to permit any of his cronies to be
                            driven from Belgrade in disgrace. Nor will he -- or the Yugoslav
                            generals - permit a protracted, bitter fight that disrupts the conduct
                            of necessary business.</p>
                        <pb n="7" xml:id="d83-07" facs="d83-07"/>
                        <p>Given these restraints, an all-out vendetta is not likely. In this
                            atmosphere we tend to think the highly pragmatic and organized <persName
                                corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> will be best able to consolidate
                            his position. We also believe that his chances will dim if the power
                            struggle causes restiveness at lower levels of the apparatus.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> must be especially alert to
                            efforts by others to manipulate the vocal and politically active
                            veterans' organization. The representatives of the old guard in the
                            leadership -- <persName corresp="#p_MM9"
                            >Minic</persName>-Ljubicic-Herljevic, for example -- might use the
                            veterans, who jealously guard their privileged status in society, by
                            casting the younger <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> as an
                            upstart intent on bringing the next generation to power. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName>'s success or failure in winning
                            the support of the Yugoslav military -- which has considerable influence
                            over the veterans -- will be a key factor in blocking attacks from this
                            quarter.</p>
                        <p>If, in <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s estimation,
                                <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> appears to over reach
                            himself, the aging President could react sharply, particularly if he
                            felt that he was being shunted aside in an unseemly fashion. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> showed some concern about this as
                            early as the last party congress in 1974, when he angrily denounced
                            Western press articles that touted him as <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName>'s heir. Recently there has been a spate of similar
                            press speculation. There are also rumors in Belgrade -- probably
                            unfounded that point toward an early <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1"
                                >Tito</persName> retirement. These stories might be used as
                            “evidence” that <persName corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> is
                            impatient for <persName corresp="#p_TMJB1">Tito</persName>'s mantle.</p>
                        <p>In a speech to a recent joint session of parliament <persName
                                corresp="#p_DS3">Dolanc</persName> appeared to deny the rumors of
                            his growing ambition. He did this by noting the danger “if someone were
                            to try to impose his partial, egotistical interests on the workers” by
                            means of his party post. At the same time, however, he argued that
                            communists alone cannot build socialism, a seeming allusion to his
                            rivals' idea of setting up a new power center in the party
                            leadership.</p>

                        <p>I. Introduction and Summary</p>
                        <p>As 1973 begins, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is on the
                            threshold of a new stage in its development. After a quarter century of
                            international ostracism, it is now virtually a fully accepted member of
                            the world community. It has been formally acknowledged by the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> as an equal. It is a full participant
                            in the ongoing preparatory talks for a <gloss target="#t_CSCE1"
                                >CSCE</gloss>, and will have the same status in the prospective
                                <gloss target="#t_MBFR1">MBFR</gloss> discussions. It has been
                            granted a seat in UNESCO and on the observer bench at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Virtually universal diplomatic
                            recognition is a matter of months, as is full membership in the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s newly-acquired international
                            stature, in part a by-product of East-West detente, and more
                            particularly <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-<gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> rapprochement, is also attributable
                            to the pragmatism of the present East German <pb n="2" xml:id="d84-02"
                                facs="d84-02"/>leadership. Upon succeeding the failing Ulbricht in
                            early 1971, Honecker shrewdly took the pulse of political change. He was
                            aware that for the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> there was no
                            alternative but to follow the thrust of Soviet Western policy, and
                            sought where possible to apply that policy to East German advantage.
                            During 1972, a well-entrenched Honecker presided over the East German
                            regime's efforts to streamline governmental operations, to increase
                            industrial and agricultural production, and to raise the standard of
                            living of its population. Despite its notable foreign policy successes
                            and its relatively impressive economic accomplishments, the regime
                            remains sensitive to the fact of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss>'s creation as a Soviet-imposed German rump state. It
                            continues, therefore, to attempt to improve its public image as a
                            sovereign political entity and to further its internal acceptability by
                            instilling in the East German population the sense of a new, separate
                            national identity. While these efforts have been only partly successful,
                            the psychological impact on the population of international acceptance
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> should make them more
                            effective.</p>
                        <p>But, as a full-fledged player on the world stage, forced to adjust to the
                            intricacies and potential pitfalls of international politics, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will also have to contend with the
                            weighty political/economic embrace of a considerably more influential
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The most immediate problem
                            stems from the diametrically opposed purposes for which the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> concluded the General Relations Treaty (GRT): for the
                            former it is a divider, for the latter a link. To dispel illusions that
                            the GRT may offer the East German population a shared future with the
                            Federal Republic, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> now can be
                            expected to apply “Abgrenzung” with stepped-up vigor. It will seek to
                            remove vestiges of traditional ties between the two Germanies. It will
                            also apply administrative measures to restrict a wide range of personal
                            contacts between East and West Germans and thus vitiate some of the
                            concessions it had to make in this regard. And it will attempt to
                            undercut <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>'s popularity in
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> by striking hard at Social
                            Democracy and the convergence theory.</p>
                        <p>As a key subordinate element in the Soviet power structure in Eastern
                            Europe, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will continue to advance
                            Soviet foreign policy. However, there is always the longer-term
                            possibility that with some of its major policy objectives achieved, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will seek new international
                            goals which may not square entirely with those of the Soviets.</p>
                        <pb n="3" xml:id="d84-03" facs="d84-03"/>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will further integrate its
                            economy into <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>, to which the bulk of
                            its trade remains committed. With its new international ties, however,
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> can be expected to try to meet
                            some of its economic requirements by expanding, within practical limits,
                            its trade with the West. Additionally, it obviously is prepared to pay a
                            political price to retain the distinct economic benefits of its present
                            trade arrangements with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>When the U.S. joins the other Allies in establishing relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, presumably some time in 1973,
                            it will for the first time have a diplomatic presence in both parts of
                            the truncated Germany. <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-<gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> relations undoubtedly will be
                            circumscribed by overriding political/military factors on both sides.
                            But, even within these narrow parameters, there are some possibilities
                            for promoting U.S. interests.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> desire for relations with the
                            U.S. and for a favorable political climate for on-going East-West
                            activities should provide the United States with useful leverage for
                            obtaining a <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> commitment to negotiate
                            on outstanding bilateral issues. It should also restrain the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, at least in the initial stages, from
                            attempting to undermine the Western position in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>
                            <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            trade relations perhaps offer the most likely immediate area for
                            progress. While the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> lacks the
                            economic potential to become a major trading partner of the U.S.,
                            transactions with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> could be
                            significant for individual U.S. firms.</p>
                        <p>Despite a steady <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> drumbeat of
                            anti-American propaganda, the East Germans display a high degree of
                            positive curiosity about and interest in the U.S., particularly among
                            the intellectuals and youth. Even though the regime is certain to impose
                            restrictions, a selective and flexible U.S. information and exchange
                            program over the long run may be able to influence a potentially
                            important segment of East German society.</p>

                        <p>For the foreseeable future, our political opportunities in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will be limited. Initial U.S. efforts,
                            therefore, will perforce be concentrated on the normalization of
                            bilateral relations and the safeguarding of our position on the status
                            of Berlin. This will also require a clear division of responsibilities

                        <p>An area where the U.S. could profitably engage the <gloss

                            consolidated further his position as the man in charge. He has acted
                            with assurance, but without unseemly haste, in presiding over the
                            revocation of the Ulbricht legacy, and has established his personal
                            primacy with a minimum of visible friction and rivalry. He has implanted
                            his style and precepts on the Party, and proved adept at moving both men
                            and policies with effectiveness. His generally colorless image has not

                            Ministers, and eliminated a number of bureaucratic sub-groups, primarily

                        <p>To deal with the prevailing public attitude of resigned acceptance, the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> leadership in 1972 intensified
                            its efforts to broaden its appeal. Greater latitude was granted in the
                            arts, although only within the context of “socialist realism.” Party
                            propagandists and agitators as well as the media were encouraged to
                            concentrate on entertainment value and human needs in their activities.
                            Increased resources were devoted to satisfying the consumer. To enhance
                            the regime's appearance of legitimacy, particular effort was made to
                            instill in the population a sense of a separate East German pride and
                            identity. Unable to develop a <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            nationalism from whole cloth, the regime has drawn heavily, and
                            selectively, from German history. By means of a dialectical
                            interpretation of the German past, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> seeks to represent itself as the embodiment of the
                            traditional good German values: the evil was interred with the Third
                            Reich or lives on in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The
                            success of this effort is questionable. While outstanding <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> successes at the Olympic games led to
                            an outburst of pride and pleasure from the East German population, the
                            broader feeling of being “German” is still deeply rooted. This feeling
                            notwithstanding, large segments of East German society are developing
                            vested interests in the continuation of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> appears on balance to have met
                            its 1972 economic goals. However, their quantitative fulfillment was
                            frequently at the cost of quality. In view of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s persistent and severe labor
                            shortages, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> recognizes that
                            increased output requires higher productivity and a more efficient
                            utilization of resources. This will call for the modernization of
                            industry, application of better managerial techniques, and improved
                            technology. Whether these requirements can be met within the framework
                            of a highly centralized, state-operated economy is moot. While its
                            intensified integration in <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> is to a
                            large extent politically motivated, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> also hopes to supplement domestic production through
                            cooperation and specialization projects with its <gloss
                                target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> partners. But it recognizes that it
                            will have to expand its trade with the West as well, even if by so doing
                            it incurs a larger trade deficit.</p>

                                >FRG</gloss> Relations</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is now in the process of settling
                            into its new relationship with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.
                            In particular, it has to cope with the diametrically opposed conceptions
                            of the General Relations Treaty: the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            views it as a license for separateness, while the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> hopes it will forge links for some form
                            of combined German future. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            consequently is intensifying its “Abgrenzung” campaign, determined to
                            cut as many traditional, national, political, and cultural ties with the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> as possible to disabuse all of
                            notions that the two Germanies have a shared future. In practical terms,
                            it is attempting to vitiate the visit and travel provisions of the
                            Quadripartite and inner-German agreements by administrative restrictions
                            on some parts of the population and stepped-up indoctrination and
                            vigilance campaigns generally. It is attempting to undercut the personal
                            popularity Chancellor <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> has
                            gained among the East Germans. It is also striking hard at Social
                            Democracy in general and at the convergence theory in particular.</p>
                        <p>Internationally, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will seek to
                            elude the weighty embrace of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.
                            Inasmuch as it cannot match West Germany's economic and political clout
                            in international councils, it probably will concentrate on establishing
                            its separate German identity as a loyal, committed member of the
                            Socialist camp. At the same time, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> will seek to gain leverage in multilateral negotiations
                            from the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s desire for an
                            inner-German link.</p>
                        <p>Trade presumably will continue to be an important bond between the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>. In 1973, this trade is likely to expand in line with
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s overall trade, or by about
                            eight to twelve percent. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            probably will remain the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s second
                            largest trading partner (after the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                            >USSR</gloss>), with about ten percent of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>'s total trade. However, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> will continue to be a relatively minor trading partner
                            of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, accounting for less than two
                            percent of the latter's total trade. The current preferential trading
                            arrangement entails some political compromises for the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and economic sacrifices for the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Yet both were sufficiently interested
                            in its continuation to include it specifically in a supplement to the
                            GRT. This mutual interest will presumably continue beyond 1975, when the
                            current swing credit arrangement expires.</p>

                        <p>The constant in Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> relations is
                            that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> is an essential component
                            of the Soviet power structure in Eastern Europe. Even wider
                            international acceptance of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>,
                            therefore, should not cause the Soviets to relax their control over the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Rather, such acceptance
                            probably will be regarded by the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>
                            as acknowledgment of its continued hegemony in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the Warsaw Pact area in
                            general.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, in turn, depends on the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> as the guarantor of its existence.
                            Its fundamental attitude, characterized by this dependence, can be
                            expected to remain unchanged for some time, even though the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> on occasion has attempted to take
                            advantage of its importance to the Warsaw Pact to extract more favorable
                            consideration from the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, especially
                            in the economic area. International recognition of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, despite its benefits to the <gloss

                                >USSR</gloss>, may introduce a new, and potentially troublesome,
                            element in their relations. As the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            develops into a fuller partner with respectable international
                            credentials, it should gain a greater sense of security. In the long
                            term, it could become more assertive with its allies, including the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. It may, for example, insist
                            on a fairer distribution of the economic costs and benefits involved in
                            the <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss> integration process.</p>
                        <p>An important but intractable factor in <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>-Soviet relations will be the further course of Soviet
                            policy towards the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Although Soviet
                            and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interests in Central Europe, as
                            elsewhere, largely coincide, broader Soviet objectives could require of
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, as they did in the recent past,
                            certain concessions and restraints not entirely to the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s liking. And there will be continuing
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> concern lest the Soviet

                            stature serve to promote a divided allegiance among the East German

                        <p>While the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> presumably will attempt to
                            diversify its foreign trade markets, the Soviet Union almost certainly
                            will remain its main trading partner. It will have to maintain its
                            extensive deliveries of finished products in <pb n="8" xml:id="d84-08"
                                facs="d84-08"/>exchange for Soviet raw materials. In other areas of
                            economic cooperation, such as research and development, it will also
                            have to remain responsive to Soviet requirements. This could be a source
                            of friction between them.</p>
                        <p>In Eastern Europe, the newly legitimized <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> will no longer be able to expect special consideration

                                >FRG</gloss> expands its relations in that area, the <gloss

                            to develop closer political, economic and cultural links with its
                            immediate Eastern neighbors, Poland and Czechoslovakia. The opening of
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> borders for visa-free travel to
                            and from these countries was part of such an effort. The difficulties
                            resulting from that move revealed the problems involved in integrating
                            disparately developed economies. But the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, in line with the <gloss target="#t_CEMA1">CEMA</gloss>
                            “Complex Program,” is likely to increase the number of bilateral
                            arrangements within that organization intended to develop new products,
                            joint productive capacity, etc. In so doing, it will also seek to
                            alleviate as far as possible its manpower problem.</p>
                        <p>V. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the Third World</p>
                        <p>Because <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> funds and personnel are
                            limited, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> probably will become
                            more selective in its attention to developing countries, now that it has
                            established diplomatic relations with countries more important to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The proportion of trade with the developing countries, therefore, is
                            likely to remain small. Favorable terms, such as concessional credit,
                            earlier granted as price for recognition, will diminish. At the same
                            time, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> probably will continue to
                            offer economic aid in support of Soviet objectives in certain areas,
                            such as the Middle East. <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> footholds
                            established in the more important less developed countries, such as
                            India and Chile, will not be relinquished.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The U.S. presumably will join the other Allies in establishing relations
                            with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> some time in 1973. For the
                            first time since the division of Germany, this will provide it with
                            diplomatic presence, and the potential for directed influence, in both
                            parts of the area covered by the Four Power rights and
                            responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>However, several factors will serve to circumscribe our relations with
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. U.S. policy toward the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> must take account of the paramount
                            importance of our relationship with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss>. It must also protect our basic interests in Berlin. As
                            regards the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, it remains an integral
                            part of the Soviet Union's Eastern European empire, with its major
                            interests coinciding with, and its policies subordinate to, those of the
                            Soviet Union. It almost certainly will regard the U.S. as a supporter of
                            special <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> aspirations concerning the
                            future of Germany.</p>
                        <p>At this juncture the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> seems
                            sufficiently interested in establishing relations with the U.S. to
                            refrain from encroaching upon our legal position on Germany and Berlin,
                            as well as related procedures and practices. It may also be relatively
                            forthcoming as regards U.S. pre-conditions for the establishment of
                            relations, including a commitment to negotiate at a later date on such
                            bilateral issues as claims, restitution, and consular matters. The
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s later general attitude may
                            reflect its own and Soviet desire to maintain a favorable atmosphere for
                            such negotiations as a <gloss target="#t_CSCE1">CSCE</gloss>.
                            Nevertheless, the possibility of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss>'s attempting even in the early stage, and especially
                            following its entry into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            gradually to alter existing Allied practices in Berlin cannot be
                            excluded. Granted that the Allies for their part may wish over a period
                            to make modifications in those-practices, it is essential that in doing
                            so the Allies avoid giving the impression that they are renegotiating
                            such rights with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Otherwise, the
                            basis of these rights would appear to have been changed from an original
                            to a contractual one.</p>
                        <p>Even if the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> were to make a general
                            commitment to negotiate on claims and restitution, a satisfactory
                            resolution is likely to be difficult to achieve. Thus far the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> has maintained that it is not a
                            successor state to the <pb n="10" xml:id="d84-10" facs="d84-10"/>Third
                            Reich and has refused, therefore, to accept any war or pre-war claims.
                            Should it be pressed on the issue, however, it may counter by advancing
                            claims of its own to former Reich assets. As regards claims to assets
                            lost by U.S. citizens since creation of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, the East Germans may be somewhat more forthcoming in
                            order to qualify for better trading conditions. However, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> clearly lacks resources to satisfy all
                            claims which a number of countries apparently plan to raise. It may also
                            seek to apply political criteria to claimants of German origin.</p>
                        <p>Trade is perhaps the most promising area for early progress in <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            relations. Thus far, this trade has been most modest--a fraction of one
                            percent of each country's trade and the potential for its expansion is
                            minor in terms of our over-all trade volume. However, it could become
                            significant for individual U.S. companies or industries. Neither the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s commitment to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CEMA1"
                                >CEMA</gloss>, nor its arrangements with the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> pose insurmountable hurdles. Since the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> apparently is interested in expanding
                            and somewhat diversifying its trade, this should make an increased share
                            of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> market available to the U.S.
                            This could be especially true for those U.S. products generally
                            unavailable elsewhere. This development can be facilitated by expanding
                            informal channels of communications with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> and by reducing unilaterally some of the current
                            obstacles to such trade. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> now
                            enjoys a good credit reputation, and U.S. measures to promote trade with
                            it would serve not only our economic but over the longer term our
                            political purposes as well.</p>
                        <p>The East German regime's lack of confidence in the allegiance of its
                            population will make it particularly sensitive about U.S. information
                            activities in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Despite a steady
                            drumbeat of anti-American propaganda, however, the population generally
                            seems to harbor no animosity toward the United States and has been
                            according visiting Americans courteous and even friendly treatment.
                            Especially among the youth and intellectuals, the high degree of
                            personal curiosity about and interest in the United States offers some
                            opportunity for reaching a potentially important segment of the East
                            German population. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> probably will
                            want to have a highly controlled exchange program with emphasis <pb
                                n="11" xml:id="d84-11" facs="d84-11"/>on arrangements that would
                            best serve its own purposes--collecting scientific and technological
                            information, propagandizing, and earning hard currency. But even so, an
                            exchange program could be turned to United States advantage. Therefore,
                            it would be in the U.S. interest not to insist on strict numerical
                            reciprocity but rather to adopt a flexible approach providing for as
                            many <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> visitors as feasible.</p>
                        <p>In the immediate future, our political objectives in the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will remain, to a large extent, a
                            function of our relationship with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> in the broader East-West context. Our initial efforts
                            in the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> will have to be aimed
                            primarily at the resolution of outstanding bilateral issues and at
                            defining our relationship with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            in such a way as to inhibit the East Germans from encroaching upon
                            quadripartite rights and responsibilities. This will also require
                            drawing clear lines of authority between the Embassy in Bonn and the
                            U.S. Mission in Berlin on the one hand, and the Embassy in East Berlin
                            on the other. As a rule, the Embassy in East Berlin presumably would
                            confine itself to <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>/<gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> bilateral-relations, with Embassy Bonn

                            and the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The U.S. could profitably cooperate with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> on matters of broader international concern, such as
                            environmental protection, conservation of fisheries, etc. The <gloss

                            eventually could have a positive influence on its policies.</p>
                        <p>Some ground work has already been laid for, our future operations in the

                            and official circles. Channels of communication for exploring <gloss

                        <p>The following recommendations are designed to build upon these efforts

                        <p>The Mission should continue to develop and maintain an appropriate range

                            with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> should be facilitated, if
                            necessary, through unilateral steps to lower some of the existing trade
                            barriers, for example by eliminating controls on exports to the <gloss

                                    challenges. In the longer term, the Allies should determine

                                    making any modifications, the Allies must avoid appearing to

                        <p>The Four Power Declaration of November 9, 1972 concerning the continuing
                            validity of Four Power rights and responsibilities following <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> entry of the two German states, and the

                                >GDR</gloss>, opened the way for friendly countries, including
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> members, to establish
                            diplomatic relations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. Most
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries, including the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and France, moved quickly to do
                            so. Before the British and French began their talks with the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, we consulted with them to coordinate
                            the substantive positions which the Three Powers would take on issues
                            which would likely arise in talks with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>. Both the British and French held generally to those
                            positions in the negotiations which they have now completed. At the
                            present, aside from ourselves, only Portugal, Greece, and Canada among
                            the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> countries have not agreed to
                            the establishment of relations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>, and Canada has indicated its intention to do so.</p>
                        <p>Our general posture has been to avoid any appearance of haste in
                            establishing relations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and
                            to keep the East Germans in the position of demandeur. This has been
                            favorably viewed by the Federal Republic and has put us in a good
                            tactical position for talks. I believe that we should now proceed with
                            substantive negotiations in order to ensure that the United States will
                            be in a position to represent and protect its interests in East Germany
                            and East Berlin. Accordingly, if you agree, I would propose that the
                            East Germans be invited to begin <pb n="2" xml:id="d85-02" facs="d85-02"
                            />talks in Washington during the first week of March. Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_SWJJ1">Stoessel</persName> would head
                            the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> negotiating team. If the
                            negotiations are successful, we would anticipate that the American and
                            East German embassies will open simultaneously in the respective
                            capitals whenever adequate facilities are available. Ambassadors would
                            not be exchanged until after the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s
                            Permanent Representative is established in East Berlin.</p>

                                    Since we have also acceded, this Convention can provide the
                                    basis for our diplomatic relationship. The East Germans have not
                                    acceded to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, however,
                                    and we will wish to achieve with them some understanding of how
                                    consular matters will be handled. We also will seek East German

                                    The property is now vacant and is within the prohibited area
                                    bordering the Wall. The East Germans own no property in
                                    Washington. We will need to reach agreement with the East
                                    Germans on the eventual utilization or exchange of the property
                                    we now own and on premises which can be used for a chancery and
                                    embassy housing pending the time when a new embassy complex is

                                    will seek authorization for an embassy cultural and information
                                    section in a building separate from the embassy chancery in East
                                    Berlin, and for trade and information offices in Leipzig and
                                    Rostock. The likelihood of achieving agreement on these
                                    additional offices is not good unless the East Germans are
                                    interested in establishing a trade and information office in New
                                    York and possibly elsewhere in the United States. On this as on
                                    most other matters to be negotiated, we will follow strictly the
                                    principle of reciprocity.</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>The West German Foreign Office has compiled a catalogue of recent
                            difficulties which the Soviets and East Europeans have been making over
                            those aspects of the Four Power Berlin Agreement that relate to the
                            Federal Republic's role in West Berlin and in representing West Berlin
                            abroad. They presented their catalogue to the Bonn group last week,
                            asking for a British-French-<gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> assessment
                            of the Soviet behavior and explaining that this would help them judge
                            how much support they could count on if they decide to push these issues
                            with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>Contrary to our expectations, however, State Secretary Frank did not
                            raise the catalogue with the Western Ambassadors at their regular
                            meeting February 12. This may suggest that top levels of the Foreign
                            Office are less concerned than the bureaucrats about these challenges to
                            the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>The catalogue (cable at Tab A) is a very mixed assortment of issues, some
                            trivial and some important, some hoary and a very few fresh. It lists
                            problems in both areas:</p>
                        <p>1. Soviet and Eastern European protests against the ties between West
                            Berlin and the Federal Republic (e. g. against the “Berlin clause” in
                            international agreements, against Bundestag voting rights for Berlin
                            deputies, against visits to West Berlin by the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> president or meetings there by West German political
                            parties).</p>
                        <p>2. Refusal to permit Federal Germany to represent West Berlin
                            internationally (e.g. in the case of a West Berliner arrested for
                            espionage in the Soviet Union; Soviet refusal to accept the West German
                            ratification <pb n="2" xml:id="d86-02" facs="d86-02"/>instrument of an
                            international agreement since it expressly applied to West Berlin;
                            insistence that West Berlin firms exhibit separately from West German
                            ones in trade fairs in the East; refusal by East European states to
                            participate in international sports or cultural events held in West
                            Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The catalogue of challenges is deficient in several respects though: <list>
                                <item>-- It fails to note that some of the Soviet “challenges”
                                    result from West German initiatives, notably from that on Berlin
                                    deputies voting rights.</item>
                                <item>-- It fails to mention that the Federal Germans have done some
                                    probing of their own to expand their West Berlin role (e. g. by
                                    scheduling new sorts of meetings there).</item>
                                <item>-- It omits the fact that in several of the areas of complaint
                                    (e. g. participation in sports and cultural events in West
                                    Berlin) the East has a positive record, overall; and</item>
                                <item>-- on the vital issue -- unimpeded civilian travel to West
                                    Berlin -- no instances of Soviet or East German misbehavior have
                                    cropped up so far.</item>
                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Clearly the Soviets are probing the ambiguities of the Quadripartite
                            Agreement trying to limit the West German role as much as possible.
                            State's preliminary reaction and that of the Bonn Group, however, is
                            that the catalogue does not permit a firm conclusion that the Soviets
                            are out systematically to undermine the Berlin Agreement. Some of the
                            West German complaints are already being taken up with the Soviets by
                            the Three allies. The Germans obviously would like to get us to take up
                            more of them, and such a request might eventually lead to controversy
                            with BONN.</p>
                        <p>I wanted you to be aware of these instances of Soviet behavior, even if
                            we cannot yet say that they constitute a pattern directed against the
                            Berlin Agreement. The situation will become more serious if the Soviets
                            start violating or permitting the East Germans to violate the access
                            provisions of the Agreement. In that case we may have to consider
                            approaching the Soviets. The present catalogue, as the West Germans
                            themselves admit, does not include any outright violations, however.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>The West German Parliament has completed ratification of the Basic Treaty
                            regulating relations between the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the Treaty has come into
                            effect. The only remaining question concerning the Treaty results from
                            an action by the state of Bavaria challenging its constitutionality
                            before the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court has committed
                            itself to render a decision by the end of July. It is anticipated that
                            the Court will find the Treaty constitutional.</p>
                        <p>Given these developments, I believe that we can now establish a general
                            time frame for negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            on the establishment of diplomatic relations. We propose to take no
                            action until after the decision of the Constitutional Court has been
                            rendered. Assuming that the decision is not of a nature to interfere
                            with the implementation of the Basic Treaty, we plan to get in touch
                            with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Observer at the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> in early August and inform him that we
                            wish to work out a schedule for bilateral talks. We intend to propose
                            that a small group from the Department go to East Berlin sometime in
                            August to look into the facilities which can be made available for the
                            establishment of an American Embassy. This would be followed in
                            September by bilateral negotiations in Washington in which the East
                            Germans would be represented by a delegation from East Berlin. We
                            consider it advantageous to send the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>

                            since an important aspect of the substantive bilateral negotiations will
                            be the premises and operating conditions which the East Germans are
                            prepared to guarantee for our Mission.</p>
                        <p>When the negotiations take place we will follow the positions described
                            in my memorandum of February 15, 1973 which you reviewed earlier.
                            Assuming the negotiations are successful we foresee the opening of an
                            American Embassy in East Berlin before the end of the year.</p>
                        <p>I find that the seating arrangement at the <gloss target="#t_CSCE1"
                                >CSCE</gloss> in Helsinki will place me next to the East German

                            sitting together, he alludes to the possibility of bilateral relations I
                            intend to say that we plan to be in touch with the East German
                            Ambassador in New York on the subject later in the year.</p>

                        <p>Summary: In seeking to put flesh on the Quadripartite Agreement's
                            provision for the maintenance and development of ties between the
                            Western Sectors of Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>,
                            local leaders have found one of the most realistic and promising
                            prospects is the establishment of new Federal offices and agencies in
                            West Berlin. The Senat is in the process of refining a list of priority
                            possibilities to present to the Federal Government. Although thought has
                            been given to obtaining Allied and possibly even Soviet approval of a
                            master list once it is agreed by the Senat and the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>, in the Mission's view it would be far
                            more desirable to proceed in a matter-of-fact way, considering each
                            proposal on its own merits. Unless there is some clear infringement on
                            reserved Allied rights, there would seem to be no reason not to pursue
                            this legitimate avenue for contributing to the vitality of the city.</p>
                        <p>End Summary.</p>
                        <p>Enclosure:</p>
                        <p>Status of Current Efforts for the Establishment and Expansion of Federal
                            Institutions in Berlin.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d89-02" facs="d89-02"/>
                        <p>Ever since the Quadripartite Agreement was signed and long before it went
                            into effect, West Berlin leaders in and out of the government sought
                            ways to promote the city's viability over the long term. Many proposals
                            have been floated, some designed to take advantage of the city's human
                            resources to build new intellectual centers, some to make West Berlin an
                            East-West trade center, and some to persuade European and international
                            organizations to establish new offices in West Berlin. Attractive as
                            these ideas appear, many of them set out in elaborate prospecti, a
                            majority have turned out to be unrealistic or difficult to implement.
                            There has been some progress, e.g., the decision to locate a <gloss
                                target="#t_WHO1">WHO</gloss> office in Berlin and the convening in
                            the city of two or three international conferences under <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> auspices. The obstacles, however, have
                            been formidable: well-established agencies such as those of the <gloss
                                target="#t_EC1">EC</gloss> in Brussels are reluctant to move or see
                            new offices set up far from home base; East-West trade has a way of
                            developing without new centers; and many institutions which are well
                            suited for Berlin find their presence is competed for by other
                            cities.</p>
                        <p>In these circumstances, one of the most promising prospects, which lies
                            wholly within German hands to initiate has been to take advantage of the
                            Quadripartite Agreement's provision for maintaining and developing ties
                            between West Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> by
                            establishing new Federal agencies and offices in West Berlin. In July,
                            the Senat formulated a master list of possibilities, and Senator for
                            Federal Affairs Stobbe indicated that he intended to prepare a letter
                            for the Governing Mayor to send to Chancellor Brandt asking the latter's
                            support for those which seemed to stand the best chance (see ref
                            airgram). This letter has not been sent, and, in the meantime, the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> has moved ahead with the
                            decision to establish in Berlin the new Federal Office for Environment
                            Protection. Although the Soviets have attempted to take advantage of
                            this decision to assert an interpretation of the <gloss target="#t_QA1"
                                >QA</gloss> to which no Western party has at any time subscribed,
                            i.e., that the Federal presence in the Western Sectors is to be reduced,
                            the project is moving ahead; the routine documents providing Allied
                            authorization have been prepared, and at this writing await only final
                            French concurrence.</p>

                        <p>Taking up where Stobbe had left off, Head of Senat Chancellery Peter Herz
                            on September 26 brought the Senat Liaison Officers up-to-date on the
                            status of plans to bring Federal organizations to Berlin and to expand
                            or increase the Federal contribution to some of the organizations
                            already there (see enclosure). Herz said that in light of the recent
                            developments concerning the Federal Environment Office, the Senat was
                            rethinking the procedures to be followed in the future. Instead of
                            Senator Stobbe's proposal, he thought it would be best to work out
                            agreement with Bonn in advance on a master list of offices to be located
                            in West Berlin and on the basis of this agreement to obtain Allied
                            approval. At that stage, the Governing Mayor would write the Chancellor
                            inviting the organizations in question to come to Berlin and, in accord
                            with a prearranged script, <persName corresp="#p_BWHF1"
                                >Brandt</persName> would send a favorable reply. Herz remained
                            concerned about Soviet reaction, however, and suggested two alternative
                            courses of action: 1) after BONN, the Senat and the Allies had reached
                            agreement, but before the letters were made public, the Soviets would be

                            West Berlin; or, 2) when the favorable reply from <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName> was announced, the Allies would
                            issue a statement that the Allies had been consulted in advance and that
                            they welcomed the establishment of the organizations in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>The Mission does not find either of these procedures necessary or
                            desirable. Both are likely to create unjustified alarm that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and the Allies were consorting together
                            to promote a “massive” expansion of Federal presence. The first
                            proposal, in particular, would not only invite trouble from the Soviets
                            but suggest they had some say in the Senat-<gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss>-Allied decision. In our view, we see considerable
                            advantage in full consultation on a continuing basis with the Allies in
                            Bonn and Berlin about future plans for Federal presence, but we would
                            favor proceeding on a step-by-step basis, much as we have to date. A
                            less dramatic and blunt approach than either of those suggested by Herz
                            has the advantage of treating each proposal in a matter-of-fact manner
                            and in accordance with established procedures. This would certainly be
                            in keeping with both the letter and spirit of the Quadripartite
                            Agreement's provisions on the development of ties.</p>

                        <p>Summary:</p>
                        <p>A year and a half after the Quadripartite Agreement (<gloss
                                target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss>) went into effect, Berlin remains
                            crisis-free, but wide differences prevail-in regard to several aspects
                            of the <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss>'s implementation. Controversy
                            has principally focused on the carefully balanced passage that “the ties
                            between the Western Sectors of Berlin and the Federal Republic of
                            Germany will be maintained and developed, taking into account that these
                            Sectors continue not to be a constituent part of the Federal Republic of
                            Germany and not to be governed by it.” The Western side has interpreted
                            this provision to mean that as long as those actions specifically
                            enjoined by the <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> are avoided, the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is free to represent Berlin
                            internationally and to sustain and build on practices of the past that
                            demonstrate that West Berlin is a part, if not a constituent part, of
                            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Thus, it is only natural that
                            West Berliners should participate in international events as members of
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> delegations, that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should, with Allied authorization,
                            represent West Berlin abroad, that Bundestag committees and political
                            parties should hold meetings in Berlin, and that Federal offices should
                            be located in Berlin as long as they exercise no direct governmental
                            authority.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d90-02" facs="d90-02"/>
                        <p>The Soviets and East Germans, on the other hand, place full emphasis on
                            the second half of the formula--ignoring the key word “continue"--and
                            attempt through repeated formal and informal complaints, as well as in
                            their own bilateral relations, to assert an independent status for West
                            Berlin. Objecting to the presence of West Berliners on <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> teams and delegations, they attempt to
                            negotiate separate arrangements for cultural and sports exchanges with
                            West Berlin. While deflecting the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s
                            efforts to negotiate on behalf of West Berlin under the terms of the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> Basic Treaty, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            holds out the promise of substantial local benefits if only the West
                            Berlin Senat will enter into separate treaties with it. Instead of
                            honoring the <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> provision on developing
                            ties, the Soviets and East Germans allege that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> presence in West Berlin should be
                            reduced in size. And only when the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            agreed to defer the question of representing West Berlin consular
                            interests abroad was Bonn able to move ahead with normalization treaties
                            with Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary.</p>
                        <p>With the debate on ties still unresolved, the trouble-free experience in
                            regard to arrangements for transit and visits has recently been marred
                            by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> attempts to introduce selectively
                            modifications in controls on transit traffic and by the imposition of
                            more burdensome currency-control regulations, which in the past few
                            weeks have had the effect of drastically reducing the flow of visitors
                            to East Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The basic visit and transit rights for most West Berliners remain
                            unimpaired, but failure on the part of both the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> and the Allies to insist on proper interpretations of
                            the <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> and inner-German agreements could
                            lead to further, more damaging efforts at reinterpretation and what
                            amounts to renegotiation. In this context, the text case posed by Soviet
                            and <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> opposition to the location in
                            West Berlin of a new Federal Environmental Agency is especially
                            significant. While hitherto it has been possible for the Allies to
                            remain silent in regard to most controversies concerning the <gloss
                                target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss>, there may be occasions when it is
                            necessary both privately and publicly to assert Western positions, lest
                            Eastern interpretations stand unrefuted <pb n="3" xml:id="d90-03"
                                facs="d90-03"/>or the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> succeed in
                            creating the impression that it has a right to interpret the work of the
                            Four Powers. Unpublicized, private approaches to the Soviets offer the
                            possibility of avoiding trouble before they or the East Germans become
                            so committed they feel they cannot afford to back down. Depending on
                            circumstances, public statements may be necessary for both morale and
                            record-building purposes. We recognize that the United States may have
                            to undertake some missionary work to convince the Allies, particularly
                            the French, who are inclined toward strict constructionism, of the need
                            to “talk back.” Failure to respond promptly to Eastern challenges,
                            however, often is likely to be regarded as a sign of vacillation and
                            division in Western ranks, which in turn might encourage the Soviets and
                            East Germans to press their case.</p>
                        <p>It is probably too soon to determine whether the November 1972
                            Quadripartite Declaration will be as effective as intended. Although the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> has been admitted to the United
                            Nations and has established diplomatic relations with most major states,
                            the fact that the United States has not yet opened an Embassy and the
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and French Ambassadors are not yet
                            in place may be restraining the Soviets and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> from attempting to alter Allied practices. In the
                            months ahead the Allies will have to observe closely <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and Soviet behavior in such vital areas
                            as access, and freedom of movement in East Berlin.</p>
                        <p>Since the Soviet Consulate General opened its doors in mid-1973, its
                            personnel, working in close conjunction with their colleagues in the
                            Soviet Embassy in East Berlin, have done their part to advance one-sided
                            interpretations of the <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss>, while

                        <p>During the past year, the Senat has demonstrated a tendency toward
                            independent action, understandable in the context of <gloss

                                >UN</gloss> and the prolonged period of Allied occupation. While
                            there is an equal tendency for the Senat to draw closer to the Allies
                            when faced with negotiating difficulties with the East, it behooves us
                            to recognize the trend toward greater independence as inescapable and to
                            accommodate to it. The Allies should not stand in the way of
                                Senat-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> negotiations on local
                            matters, provided that reserved Allied rights are not affected, and we
                            should avoid overreliance on formal Allied Kommandatura machinery in our
                            relations with the Senat.</p>
                        <p>Western insistence, for valid political reasons, on free access to the
                            Western Sectors of Berlin has always posed law-and-order problems. These
                            have become more acute in recent months, as a flow of Jewish refugees
                            into the city, combined with a large increase in the Arab population,
                            many of them allegedly seeking asylum, has created a potentially,
                            explosive situation. Local authorities are also more concerned about
                            narcotics control. We recommend urgent consultation with our Allies and
                            the Senat to devise entry controls and expedite disposition of asylum
                            cases, a course which we believe is possible without modifying
                            fundamental Western positions.</p>
                        <p>Growing awareness of the need to enhance West Berlin's sense of belonging
                            at a time when it is no longer a center of world attention has not been
                            matched by concrete accomplishments. Established international
                            institutions are reluctant to set up branch offices in Berlin, far from
                            home base, while proponents of new institutions are not always able to
                            persuade potential participants of the practicality of ideas attractive
                            in theory. German-wide organizations continue to offer the most promise.
                            The <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should be encouraged on a
                            selective and carefully timed basis to support the location in the city

                                Soviet/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> challenges when making
                            decisions about its own facilities, as long as these are consistent with

                        <p>The completion in 1974 of Tegel Airport as an ultramodern, convenient
                            airport theoretically should give West Berlin an edge in developing as
                            an international air center. Unfortunately, however, moves to attract
                            new carriers to come to West Berlin have generally been made reluctantly
                            and too late. As a consequence, West Berlin has continued to lose out to
                            Schoenefeld in the development of air services. Early Allied approval of
                            landing rights for non-Allied carriers clearly interested in pressing
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> for overflight rights will be

                            European center, the city is bound to suffer from the current energy
                            crisis that affects all of Europe. It may be necessary for the <gloss

                            measures to forestall a worsening of the always-latent sense of

                        <p>The graphic and performing arts is one area in which the United States'
                            actions are not dependent upon outside influences. With the Soviets
                            stepping up their cultural offensive in the Western Sectors, and in view
                            of the probability that major American cultural attractions will be
                            presented in East Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, it
                            is important that the United States be represented in West Berlin by at
                            least a limited number of outstanding examples of its cultural life that
                            will demonstrate continued interest in the city.</p>

                            international status that the United States itself undertake no steps
                            that could signal declining willingness to stand by its Berlin
                            commitment and be misinterpreted by the Soviets or the <gloss

                            warrant the risks entailed. We recognize, however, that some reductions

                        <p>I. The Quadripartite Agreement: Testing Interpretations</p>
                        <p>After a year and a half of probing and testing of the Quadripartite
                            Agreement, Berliners have come routinely to partake of its personal
                            benefits--visits to East Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> and expedited transit to and from West Germany--but a
                            number of key issues remain serious points of contention. While the
                            Soviets and the East Germans have thus far exercised care to avoid
                            critical confrontation that would directly engage parties to the <gloss
                                target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> under its consultative clause, they
                            appear embarked on a coordinated campaign to obtain through
                            interpretation objectives they failed to achieve in the negotiation of
                            the <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> proper and the Inner-German
                            agreements that followed.</p>
                        <p>This attempt at what amounts to a form of renegotiation has two facets,
                            not immediately related, but by implication and innuendo increasingly
                            linked in Soviet-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> tactical
                            approaches: an attempt to establish restrictive interpretations of the
                            Agreement's provisions on ties between West Berlin and the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>; and an effort to take unilateral
                            actions in areas not explicitly covered by the <gloss target="#t_QA1"
                                >QA</gloss> that in turn impinge adversely on the tangible benefits
                            Berliners have hitherto enjoyed.</p>
                        <p>Controversy about the first aspect has principally concerned the
                            carefully balanced passage that “the ties between the Western Sectors of
                            Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany will be maintained and
                            developed, taking into account that these Sectors continue not to be a
                            constituent part of the Federal Republic of Germany and not to be
                            governed by it.” The Western side has interpreted this provision to mean
                            that as long as those actions specifically enjoined by the <gloss
                                target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> are avoided, the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> is free to represent Berlin internationally and to
                            sustain and build on practices of the past that demonstrate that West
                            Berlin is a part, if not a constituent part, of the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Thus, it is only natural that West
                            Berliners should participate in international events as members of
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> delegations, that the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should, with Allied authorization
                            represent West Berlin abroad, and that political activities not
                            explicitly prohibited by the <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> should
                            take place as in the past.</p>

                        <p>The Soviets and East Germans, on the other hand, place full emphasis on
                            the second half of the formula--ignoring the key word “continue"--and
                            attempt through repeated formal and informal complaints, as well as in
                            their own bilateral relations, to assert an independent status for West
                            Berlin. Objecting to the presence of West Berliners on <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> teams and delegations, they attempt to
                            negotiate separate arrangements for cultural and sports exchanges with
                            West Berlin. While deflecting the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s
                            efforts to negotiate on behalf of West Berlin under the terms of the

                            holds out the promise of substantial local benefits if only the West
                            Berlin Senate will enter into separate treaties with it. Instead of
                            honoring the <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> provision on developing
                            ties, the Soviets and East Germans allege that the <gloss

                            reduced in size (ignoring the fact that the Agreement says nothing about
                            “presence”). Soviet/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> protests have
                            been registered against the takeover of Federal legislation in Berlin
                            and the convening in Berlin of meetings of Bundestag committees and
                            political parties. And, despite the successful implementation of a
                            scenario painstakingly worked out in advance by the Allies with the
                            Soviets that assured the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s
                            representation of West Berlin in the United Nations, the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> has objected to such representation in
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>'s specialized agencies.</p>
                        <p>Against the backdrop of some 65 Federal offices with 47,000 employees in
                            the city, the tendentious Soviet/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            argument that Federal presence should be reduced has focused
                            particularly on Bonn's announced intention to locate in West Berlin a
                            new Federal Environmental Agency. Whereas earlier protests bearing on
                            West Berlin-<gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> ties, once made, have
                            been dropped when answered by either the German authorities or the
                            Allies, in this instance the Eastern side has orchestrated formal notes
                            to the Allies in Moscow, oral protests to the Allied Missions in Berlin,
                            and protests by <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> negotiators to both
                            Senat and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> authorities. The Soviets
                            and East Germans probably have been somewhat encouraged to take a stand
                            on this issue by the long delays in answering Soviet allegations, which
                            they doubtless regard as a sign of vacillation and division in Western

                            its guns and go ahead with the formal action that remains to be taken.

                        <p>A second major controversy, which threatened for a time to hold up the

                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is entitled to represent Berlin under
                            the terms of the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-<gloss

                            arrangements and an urban development project involving Reichsbahn
                            property. While no explicit linkage has been established between the two
                            categories, <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> spokesmen frequently
                            accuse the Senat of foot-dragging in those areas where the Senat is
                            least anxious to negotiate directly.</p>
                        <p>Cognizant of the pitfalls in <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> attempts
                            to score legal-theory points, both through an extension of the area

                            and by the form and terminology of the agreements reached, the Allies
                            have worked out with the Senat an authorization to permit local
                            administrative arrangements to be concluded in practical and
                            humanitarian fields without undermining the possibilities for <gloss

                            interests. This authorization, calling for full consultation with the
                            Allies and specific authorization before the conclusion of individual
                            agreements, is now being tested.</p>

                        <p>By and large, the <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> provisions in regard
                            to the transit of goods and persons between the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> and West Berlin have continued to run smoothly.
                            Automobile passenger traffic in the first eleven months of the year, for
                            example was up 22 percent compared with 1972, and 75 percent compared
                            with 1971, whereas air traffic in the same period declined sharply by 21
                            percent compared with 1971. Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> has been increasingly inclined to assert its authority
                            and place limits on those <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> provisions
                            which seem to it to permit room for interpretation. Distressed by a
                            marked increase in exfiltration, particularly of skilled professionals,
                            the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> has imposed more stringent spot
                            checks on autobahn traffic, and, in order to discourage the operations
                            of professional exfiltration rings, staged an exfiltrator show trial and
                            began to publicize heavy prison sentences meted out to exfiltrators.
                            Further control over autobahn traffic was imposed on travelers from
                            Greece and Turkey on the ground of possible contamination with
                            hoof-and-mouth disease, even though indiscriminate implementation of the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> controls initially excluded many
                            travelers who had not been in the allegedly affected areas for months or
                            even years. The seemingly clumsy <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            controls were eventually put on a more rational basis after an exchange
                            of messages between <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> authorities, but it appeared that a
                            prime <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> motive was to assert a right
                            unilaterally to interpret the “public order” and “misuse” provisions of
                            the Transit Agreement and to impose such controls as it saw fit, rather
                            than to control disease.</p>
                        <p>Toward the end of the year, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> took
                            a step which seemed to large numbers of West Berliners partially to
                            rescind benefits they thought they had achieved from the <gloss
                                target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss>. Mandatory currency-exchange provisions
                            for visitors to East Berlin and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>
                            were doubled and made applicable for the first time to pensioners. What
                            was previously a nuisance fee thereby became a serious financial
                            consideration for many, as seen in the immediate reduction by close to
                            fifty percent in the flow of visitors. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> was probably concerned about the possibility of
                            unprogrammed spontaneous events resulting from too large a flow of
                            visitors and too free an exchange of ideas, and saw in the new measure
                            an easy way to keep up the level of foreign exchange while cutting back
                            drastically on the number of visitors. Senat and <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> protests against the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> measure have thus far been of no avail, and the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> has counterattacked with demands that
                            the Senat and <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> should crack down on
                            “currency speculation” in East Marks.</p>
                        <pb n="10" xml:id="d90-10" facs="d90-10"/>
                        <p>It would appear that the period of Eastern give in the context of <gloss
                                target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> implementation is essentially over and
                            any further concession will be obtained only at a price. The Soviet and
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> interpretations of the <gloss
                                target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> discussed above violate the Agreement's
                            spirit as understood in the West, and, in some instances, may come close
                            to violating the letter of the Agreement as well. Although it was
                            possible for many months for the Allies to leave it to the German
                            parties to resolve their differences, it would appear likely that even
                            if controversies are not taken to the level of formal Quadripartite
                            discussion, it will be necessary on occasion for the Allies both
                            privately and publicly to set forth their understanding of the
                            Agreement. Private approaches to the Soviets, if made effectively and in
                            sufficient time, may serve to prevent Eastern positions from becoming
                            frozen through public exposure. There are to be sure some fundamental
                            differences among the Allies, with the French, for example, being more
                            inclined to a strict-constructionist view. Should the Allies fail to
                            show necessary concern about Soviet and <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> actions, however, the stage will be set for further
                            whittling away of the achievements of 1971-72. The additional danger is
                            that Berliners may feel the Western side regarded the <gloss
                                target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> principally as a device to advance
                            detente, but was not willing to defend what it wrought. It is also
                            important that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> not be permitted
                            to insinuate a right to interpret the <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss>
                            that is properly a Four Power prerogative.</p>
                        <p>II. Effects of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Recognition</p>
                        <p>Thus far, West Berlin has survived the shock of full international
                            recognition of the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> and the expansion
                            of the East Berlin diplomatic community, partly because most of the new
                            foreign missions are still getting established, and partly because
                            diplomatic life on the other side of the Wall has not turned out to be
                            all that exciting. There has been some watering down of foreign
                            representation in West Berlin, but the downgrading to date (e.g.,
                            reduction to a minimal presence of the Norwegian Military Mission and
                            the closing down of the Uruguayan Consulate General) has been balanced
                            by the re-establishment of two new Consulates General in addition to
                            that of the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> (Iran and the Republic
                            of Korea), with the prospect that other East European Consulates General
                            will soon open.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="d90-11" facs="d90-11"/>
                        <p>It is probably too soon to determine whether the November 1972
                            Quadripartite Declaration will be as effective as intended. There have
                            been incidents that could be interpreted as part of a <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> effort to assert its sovereignty in
                            regard to Allied traffic on the access routes and in East Berlin, but
                            these do not yet form a pattern. The Soviets for their part have
                            generally continued to make the right responses to Allied complaints,
                            while themselves remaining on best behavior. However, the fact that the
                            United States has not yet established diplomatic relations with the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, and the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> and French Ambassadors are not yet in place, may be
                            restraining Soviets and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> from
                            attempts to alter Allied practices. The view expressed last year that we
                            might eventually have to give up some activities most offensive to
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> sensitivities, e.g., Allied
                            military patrols in East Berlin, while holding tightly to those rights
                            which are most vital, e.g., unrestricted use of the access routes, still
                            holds.</p>
                        <p>Particularly, during this transition period, the involvement of Allied
                            personnel in exfiltration, while only a minor element of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s exfiltration problem, poses a risk to
                            trouble-free preservation of Allied practices.</p>
                        <p>III. The Russians are Here</p>
                        <p>With minor exceptions, the facilities and personnel the Soviets were
                            authorized to establish in West Berlin by the terms of the <gloss
                                target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> were in place by mid-1973, after months
                            of Soviet haggling over administrative details. Once in operation,
                            however, the Soviets lost no time in establishing and cultivating
                            wide-ranging contacts in political, cultural, educational, and
                            journalistic circles in West Berlin. They have been very active, in some
                            cases, to the point of aggressiveness, and have been encouraged by the
                            receptiveness of many local officials and other leaders to their
                            advances.</p>
                        <p>The Soviet Consulate General, which has exhibited only marginal interest
                            in routine consular tasks, has already made an identifiable impact.
                            Apparently its principal assignment for the present is to lay the
                            groundwork arrangements for a separate <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>-West Berlin Cultural Agreement by promoting direct
                            exchanges between Soviet and West Berlin cultural groups and by
                            scheduling performances by Soviet artists without the intermediary of
                            agencies and associations in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. By
                            way of contrast, the Office of Soviet Trade Associations has thus far
                            maintained a low profile, and has not as yet entered into contracts with
                            major firms and commercial groups in West Berlin.</p>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="d90-12" facs="d90-12"/>
                        <p>The pattern of Soviet behavior over the past six months suggests that
                            they are bent on establishing an image of the Soviet Union as an active
                            and conspicuous force in West Berlin on a parity with the three Western
                            Allies. Toward this end the Soviets continue to test the limits of
                            Allied tolerance to a broad and on-sided interpretation of the relevant
                            provisions of the <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss>, and utilize
                            opportunities to suggest that their authorized offices and agencies have
                            a status superior to that of other foreign establishments. Finally, the
                            Soviets in West Berlin, in close coordination with the Soviet Embassy in
                            East Berlin, do their best to advance well-established East Bloc
                            interpretations of the <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss>. No detail or
                            incident is considered too insignificant for possible exploitation to
                            Soviet advantage (see Berlin A-266). Thus far, however, when
                            transgressions of the ground rules set with the Allies, e.g., adherence
                            to German and Allied laws and regulations, avoidance of political
                            activities, etc., have been called to Soviet attention, they have
                            indicated no desire for confrontation. We are left with the impression
                            that Soviet goals are long-range and that they are content to lay their
                            groundwork carefully.</p>
                        <p>Tiresome as the task may be, the United States Mission, in whose sector
                            most of the Soviets are located, will have to continue to bear the brunt
                            of monitoring Soviet activity and calling the Soviets to account when
                            they step out of bounds.</p>
                        <p>IV. Local Political Scene</p>
                        <p>Berlin politics have remained on an unusually even keel throughout most
                            of the past year. While each of the major parties, especially the <gloss

                            of factionalism, pragmatic solutions have been found in each case to
                            avoid open splits. Today, as in the past, there is a tendency for
                            administration and opposition to close ranks on issues related to the
                            city's well-being so that lines of partisan politics are somewhat

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> remains in firm control,
                            continuing to make do without entering into coalition with the FDP on
                            the pattern of the Bonn government. Governing Mayor Schuetz, having
                            coveted without success a leading position in <persName
                                corresp="#p_BWHF1">Brandt</persName>'s post-election government last

                                xml:id="d90-13" facs="d90-13"/>his political future in Berlin.
                            Whereas a year ago Schuetz was in almost continuous altercation either
                            with Bonn or his own party in Berlin, since the early part of 1973 he
                            has stayed out of trouble and has taken positions generally acceptable
                            from a Berlin, as opposed to a partisan point of view. His ability to
                            speak up unrefuted has been assisted by divisions within the <gloss
                                target="#t_SPD1">SPD</gloss> in Bonn in the wake of Wehner's
                            controversial pronouncement in Moscow. And when the <gloss

                            West German differences, made a number of heavy-handed personal attacks
                            on Schuetz, the net affect was to enhance the Governing Mayor's local
                            prestige.</p>
                        <p>While Schuetz remains pretty much a loner, and some fairly attractive
                            younger leaders are active in the party, no one has emerged as a
                            plausible rival to leadership of the Berlin <gloss target="#t_SPD1"
                                >SPD</gloss>. Moreover, the results of the first round of
                            local-organization elections looking to 1975 indicate that, despite the
                            latent strength of the left wing, compromises will continue to be worked
                            out as in the past with the dominant right wing.</p>
                        <p>The university situation, Berlin's most troublesome local political
                            problem, remains in a turbulent state, plagued by sporadic student
                            strikes and campaigns of violence and disruption directed by small
                            extremist elements against “reactionary” professors and the
                            self-governing apparatus of the universities. In the absence of a
                            unifying external issue such as Vietnam, the radicals and extremists
                            have mobilized substantial campus support by placing themselves in the
                            vanguard of the opposition to a reform of the Berlin University Law that
                            would increase the direct authority of the state and restore to the
                            senior faculty some of their lost power. The less conspicuous parallel
                            effort by radicals and extremists to take over the universities from
                            within by dominating the various decision-making bodies has also
                            persisted, although it has met with more determined resistance on the
                            part of moderate faculty and staff. On the governmental plane, the Senat
                            has stood by its plan for basic amendment of the University Law, but the
                            timetable calling for action to be completed by 1975 has been set aside
                            as a result of the vociferous opposition of the universities, and, more
                            recently, submission to the Bundestag of a comprehensive legislative
                            proposal for revamping the higher-education system. Some revision of the
                            University Law has been achieved, however, through passage of a bill
                            implementing the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court that full
                            professors should have a predominant voice in university decisions on
                            teaching and research.</p>

                        <p>V. Economic Scene</p>
                        <p>An improvement in Berlin's viability was indicated by an increase in the
                            percentage of imports of goods paid for by goods exported from 84.5 in
                            1970 to 88.6 in 1972. For the first six months of 1973 Berlin <gloss
                                target="#t_GNP1">GNP</gloss> increased by 6% in real terms, an
                            achievement that meant that, for the first time since 1967, real growth
                            was as rapid in Berlin as in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>.
                            But this may be a peak. In the third quarter, the economy began to cool
                            somewhat, with new orders down to about the level of current production
                            and demand for employment and retail turnover also down slightly.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps by coincidence, Berlin economic activity began to pick up
                            simultaneously with the conclusion of the Quadripartite Agreement, While
                            many Berlin businessmen say that the Brandt government's Ostpolitik has
                            involved compromises at Berlin's expense which will soon adversely
                            affect the Berlin economy, such views seem designed more to protect the
                            preferences Berlin receives from the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            than to forecast events. The economic indicators to date are more
                            optimistic.</p>
                        <p>In 1973, for the first time, plans for investment in manufacturing
                            industry in Berlin exceeded DM 1 billion. The economy still has to
                            contend with a disproportionately high number of older persons in the
                            population, and the difficulty of attracting workers from the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to come to Berlin and of keeping
                            midcareer talent in Berlin from being tempted by the broader horizons of
                            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. But nature is slowly remedying
                            the over-age problem, and the reduction in the working population
                            resulting from a large number of retirements and a net emigration of
                            older workers has been offset by a sharper increase in productivity in
                            Berlin than in the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Berlin's economy
                            necessarily continues to be irrationally structured and vulnerable not
                            only to possible Eastern countermeasures but also to any substantial
                            decrease in <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> support. But fears that
                            the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> will grow tired of supporting
                            the city have not been borne out. There have been no serious attempts
                            this year to reduce preferences and the Berlin aid item in the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> budget has been large enough and
                            determined early enough to avoid concern.</p>
                        <p>Berlin is expected to suffer from the energy crisis in much the same way
                            as the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> since the two economies are
                            tied <pb n="15" xml:id="d90-15" facs="d90-15"/>closely together.
                            Fortunately the city obtains much of its power and heat from coal, and
                            fuel stocks, especially of coal, are at relatively high levels.
                            Energy-intensive, petrochemical, and automotive industries are for the
                            most part not represented in Berlin. However, the city has no special
                            protection from the general shortage and rising prices of oil, nor from
                            the overall inflation and economic slowdown which will probably soon
                            come, and Berlin fuel stocks must be protected against the contingency
                            of trouble on the access routes. Consideration may have to be given to
                            some special treatment for Berlin in regard to fuel-conservation
                            measures affecting the air and land access routes if the city's always
                            latent sense of isolation is not to be aggravated.</p>
                        <p>VI. Changing Relations with the Senat</p>
                        <p>During the past year, the Senat has indicated a certain amount of chafing
                            at close Allied direction, and has been less willing to consult with the
                            Allies early in the decision-making process, particularly in regard to
                            negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>. This change
                            in attitude is partly a matter of Senat personalities and partly a
                            result of what are perceived as opportunities for independent action in
                            the post-<gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> period.</p>
                        <p>The Senat's tendency toward independent action has been less in evidence
                            in the past few months as the pace of East-West negotiations has slowed
                            down, and the East's tough stance on various issues has demonstrated
                            anew for the Senat its dependence upon Allied political support.
                            However, it probably represents a long-term trend not altogether
                            unnatural after twenty-eight years of occupation.</p>
                        <p>In our view, the best way to maintain good relations with the Senat and
                            still assure ultimate Allied control in the areas of reserved rights
                            accepted by all responsible elements of Berlin political life is to take
                            the Senat into our confidence in regard to Allied thinking, while
                            encouraging the Senat to do the same with the Allies. This will entail
                            toleration of a certain amount of independent action by the Senat, and,
                            for the United States, a good deal of negotiation with our British and
                            French Allies. We do not have in mind a fundamental change in
                            Allied-Senat relationships, but the <pb n="16" xml:id="d90-16"
                                facs="d90-16"/>adoption of a mental set that reflects sensitivity to
                            the changing times. There is nothing to be gained from repeated
                            insistence on our rights, and maintenance of a tight hold on all Senat
                            decisions, however minor, as the French would do. A major advantage of a
                            more relaxed approach would be to preserve options for the Allied role
                            in West Berlin over the long haul.</p>
                        <p>VII. Confidence-Building Measures</p>
                        <p>Efforts to sustain a sense of progress in West Berlin against the
                            combined forces of East Berlin's enhanced status as a diplomatic center
                            and the disappearance of Berlin issues from the front pages of the world
                            press have concentrated on attempts to bring new institutions to the
                            city and to develop West Berlin as an international air center.</p>
                        <p>During the past year, a small <gloss target="#t_WHO1">WHO</gloss>
                            research office has come to the city, two international meetings
                            sponsored by UNIDO were convened in West Berlin, and, as noted above, it
                            is intended to locate the Federal Environment Office in West Berlin.
                            Numerous other projects, however, have been stymied because of the
                            desire of major international institutions to remain centralized or to
                            locate in established international centers; the competition of other
                            cities; and the difficulty of selling in practice projects attractive in
                            theory.</p>
                        <p>The Senat, accordingly, has cut its shopping list to concentrate on
                            proposals with the greatest promise of achievement. This selective
                            approach appears to be the best course. We should throw in our weight
                            and encourage the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> to do so also
                            whenever useful and justified. Federal institutions thus far seem to
                            offer more hope of realization than international organizations, a
                            factor which makes even more significant the final decision on the
                            establishment of the Federal Environment Office, discussed above.</p>
                        <p>On the international air front, Tegel Airport is scheduled to open toward
                            the end of 1974 as one of the most modern, convenient municipal air
                            facilities in the world, but plans to bring new air services to the city
                            are on dead center. The two airlines thus far granted Allied permission
                            to land in West Berlin, SAS and AUA, have been indifferent in pressing
                                <pb n="17" xml:id="d90-17" facs="d90-17"/>for <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> overflight rights, while the British,
                            for commercial reasons, have dragged their feet in extending a proffer
                            of landing rights to other carriers, such as JAT (Yugoslavia) or THY
                            (Turkey) that seem more interested and may have a better chance. In the
                            meantime, air services to East Berlin's airport, Schoenefeld, continue
                            to expand.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> apparently has Soviet
                            agreement in principle for a West Berlin stopover en route
                            Frankfurt-Moscow, the most likely new carrier to come to West Berlin
                            remains Lufthansa. It will be important in making arrangements for such
                            service to resist Soviet efforts to broaden technical discussions into a
                            general renegotiation of existing Berlin air arrangements. This will be
                            equally true whenever negotiations take place on an <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> air
                            agreement, in view of the possibility that the East Europeans are likely
                            at some stage to argue that the Berlin Control Zone and corridor
                            procedures apply only to military flights. Any <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> demand for a separate bilateral air agreement with the

                            airlines wishing to come to West Berlin--would, of course, be totally
                            unacceptable.</p>

                            in a one-for-one reduction in frequencies so as to increase BEA's load
                            factor and market share. Some of the measures desired by BEA may have to
                            be accepted as a matter of expediency during the current fuel shortage,
                            but over the long haul Pan Am should not be asked to solve BEA's
                            commercial problems. It would be useful to keep BEA in the inner-German
                            service, but if such participation is reduced to a token minimum, this
                            would still be acceptable.</p>
                        <p>VIII. Strength of the United States Garrison Force</p>
                        <p>The Berlin Brigade symbolizes for most Berliners the Allied commitment to
                            the city; significant changes in its strength are certain to be closely
                            analyzed for their political import--more so than comparable changes in
                            British or French troop strength. Helpful as the Quadripartite Agreement
                            has been in solving many practical problems, it has not changed the
                            basic dilemma posed by the city's geography. To the <pb n="18"
                                xml:id="d90-18" facs="d90-18"/>contrary, there is considerable
                            concern that in the quest for detente and in the course of negotiation
                            over broad European issues, Berlin's interests might be sacrificed. The
                            destabilizing move that a major change in the Allied Forces would
                            constitute might well be interpreted by the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> as a basic change in United States policy, which in
                            turn could invite some of the moves discussed in II above that the
                            Allies have attempted to forestall.</p>
                        <p>We would not wish to suggest, however, that minor reductions could not be
                            effected, or that the possibility should be completely ruled out of
                            larger reductions at an advanced stage of <gloss target="#t_MBFR1"
                                >MBFR</gloss> negotiations, should they assume critical importance
                            at the time. Even in this context, however, it will be necessary not
                            only to take a close reading of the political situation prevailing at
                            the time, but to bear in mind that the Berlin Forces are not <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> Forces and attempts to include Berlin
                            in the <gloss target="#t_MBFR1">MBFR</gloss> negotiating area could
                            create complications with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, which
                            is an <gloss target="#t_MBFR1">MBFR</gloss> negotiator, and might assert
                            aright that we still regard as a Soviet responsibility to speak on
                            Berlin matters. Moreover, we would wish to make sure that any United
                            States Force reductions were matched by proportionate British and French
                            reductions lest ours become a minority force.</p>
                        <p>IX. Policing an Open City</p>
                        <p>In the past few months, a marked increase in the number of Arabs entering
                            West Berlin, many of them allegedly seeking political asylum, combined
                            with a flow through the city of Jewish refugees, has created a
                            potentially explosive situation. The outspokenly pro-Israel position of
                            the Governing Mayor and the leaders of all of Berlin's major political
                            parties has accentuated concern about terrorist activity, and the recent
                            arrest of four Lebanese Arabs (now awaiting trial), with explosives in
                            their possession, has pointed up the reality of the threat.</p>
                        <p>Efforts to control terrorists, however, as well as to check the
                            introduction into the city of narcotics--which the local authorities now
                            acknowledge is a German problem, and not just one affecting the United
                            States Forces--have long been <pb n="19" xml:id="d90-19" facs="d90-19"
                            />frustrated by the Western concept that Greater Berlin should be
                            treated as a single open city.</p>
                        <p>We believe the time has probably come to consider imposing more effective
                            operational controls at all entry points to West Berlin. A first step
                            was taken following the Munich Olympic experience, when checks were
                            tightened at the Waltersdorfer Chaussee entry point leading from
                            Schoenefeld airport. But this simply diverted illicit entries to other
                            crossing points. While a number of practical problems would present
                            themselves, principally in regard to checks on U-bahn and S-bahn
                            traffic, it should be possible, without doing violence to Berlin
                            theology of almost three decades standing, to close the loopholes at the
                            remaining entry points.</p>
                        <p>This could be done on the grounds that the Senat and Allies have no way
                            of knowing what controls the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> applies
                            to persons entering East Berlin or what information the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> derives therefrom. Accordingly,
                            controls on entry into the Western Sectors could be justified as being
                            imposed at the first point feasible for the local authorities in West
                            Berlin, as well as at the point of entry into the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'S customs territory.</p>
                        <p>A complementary effort will be required to contend with Arabs asking
                            political asylum, inasmuch as German law now requires all such claimants
                            to be admitted. Although we are assured that most Arab requests for
                            asylum will eventually be denied, the over-all processing time,
                            including appeals to the courts, takes two to three years. Accordingly,
                            it will be necessary to speed up administrative processes and possibly
                            to alter legislation, never intended to apply to large numbers of
                            potential terrorists in the first place.</p>
                        <p>Once adequate controls are imposed, the Senat could make a supplementary
                            effort by suggesting to the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> a local
                            administrative arrangement for the exchange of information and
                            cooperation, at least in regard to narcotics control.</p>

                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> BODIES IN BERLIN. HE SAID HIS
                            GOVERNMENT AMAZED THAT ALLIES HAVE APPROVED AND ATTEMPTED JUSTIFY ACTION
                            TAKEN BY <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> IN FLAGRANT CONTRADICTION
                            OF <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss>. HE POSTULATED THAT PERHAPS

                        <p>SECRET</p>
                        <p>PAGE 02 STATE 024423</p>
                        <p>HOSTILE TO <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss>, AND THAT ALLIES FELT THEY

                        <p>2. SECRETARY RESPONDED THAT <gloss target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> PERMITS NEW
                            TIES BETWEEN WEST BERLIN AND <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. WHAT
                            IT PROHIBITS ARE ACTIONS WHICH WOULD MAKE <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> GOVERNING POWER OVER WEST BERLIN. FEA, EVEN THOUGH
                            LOCATED IN WEST BERLIN, OPERATES IN <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            IN SENSE OF EFFECT OF ITS ACTIONS. NO QUESTION THAT SOME THINGS ARE
                            PERMISSIBLE IN WEST BERLIN AND SOME IMPERMISSIBLE. ALLIES ARE PREPARED
                            DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THEM AND VETO LATTER. ACTION TO SET UP FEA CANNOT BE
                            UNDONE.</p>
                        <p>3. <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName> REITERATED THAT <gloss
                                target="#t_QA1">QA</gloss> STATES FLATLY THAT WEST BERLIN CANNOT BE
                            ADMINISTERED BY <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> AND ASKED HOW WE CAN
                            DEAL WITH PROBLEM.</p>

                            CONSULTATION.) HE THEN SAID THAT THIS FEA STEP WILL CERTAINLY PRODUCE A
                            REACTION IN <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, WHICH CANNOT ACT AS A
                            BYSTANDER. HE EXPRESSED HOPE <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> WILL

                        <p>5. SECRETARY SAID HE WOULD LOOK FURTHER INTO SITUATION, BUT URGED
                                <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName> TO URGE <gloss

                            You recall that we discussed this when I was in Washington and you said
                            that you would think it over and talk it over with your allies. And I
                            understand that you later discussed this with Minister Scheel and
                            perhaps others during the Washington Energy Conference.</p>

                            precision of expression and I must say this is not the outstanding
                            characteristic of the German Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d92-02" facs="d92-02"/>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName>: We would still like to
                            discuss this matter. It is not in our mutual interest to have
                            difficulties over the issue of Berlin emerge. We have talked to the
                            representatives of the Federal Republic with a view of settling the
                            matter of the Federal Environmental Office and also with the intention
                            of not having this kind of problem arise again.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: I have the impression that there are two aspects in the case
                            of the Federal Environmental Office: first, the intrinsic merits of that
                            case and, second, the question of what sort of precedent it would set
                            for a whole set of succeeding measures.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName>: That is so. Both aspects
                            are of interest and are of importance.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: On the other hand, the Government of the Federal Republic has
                            taken a public position on the Federal Environmental Office. They have
                            stated that it will have mainly research functions and no administrative
                            authority. So we have tried to find a solution in this framework. It
                            seems to us that a solution is possible which will meet all concerns.
                            The Federal Environmental Office was announced without consultation with
                            the three Western Powers. We were not consulted before the legislation
                            was submitted. In the case of any new projects I believe that the
                            Federal Republic would agree that no additional projects for the
                            establishment of offices in West Berlin would go forward without
                            consultation with the three Western Powers. What this would mean is that
                            no further projects could be undertaken unless we agree. Formally this
                            would mean that the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> would submit any
                            plans it has to the three Western Powers. For its part the <gloss
                                target="#t_US1">US</gloss> would not approve such projects and the
                            Government of the Federal Republic would understand this action.
                            Therefore, I can say that the establishment of the Environmental Office
                            is not the first in a continuing series of such projects. If a project
                            is proposed in West Berlin the Government of the Federal Republic will
                            not approve its establishment except by the procedures I have outlined.
                            It seems to us that this is a constructive solution to the problem.</p>

                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName>: In so far as the future
                            is concerned, I do see certain constructive elements in your proposal.
                            The Federal Republic will not in the future be taking steps which run
                            counter to the Quadrapartite Agreement.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: I can see that as usual you are not going overboard in your
                            enthusiasm. Some time during our discussions I would like to see you
                            more enthusiastic but I can see that you are less imbued with enthusiasm
                            in this case.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName>: Well, let me explain why
                            I say there are certain constructive elements. Without your consent or
                            without the consent of any of the three Powers such a decision to go
                            ahead with the project in West Berlin will be disapproved. But I must
                            ask where is the Soviet Union in all this? We are a party to the
                            Quadrapartite Agreement but that is not the crux of the problem. Our
                            position remains as it has been. You seem to say that the Federal
                            Environmental Office will stay. We cannot accept this. The Federal
                            Environmental Office is unlawful and is counter to the Quadrapartite
                            Agreement. Our position remains valid. I would like to add that it seems
                            to me the way out of this situation is through suspension of the
                            implementation of that decision. In actual fact there has been no
                            physical step yet taken to create this office in Berlin. Therefore, the
                            way out is to suspend that action. We could think about ways to rectify
                            the situation politically and juridically. If that is not done (the
                            decision suspended), we reserve the right to raise this problem with all
                            parties to the Quadrapartite Agreement.</p>
                        <p>We sometimes hear voices among the Western Powers that the Soviets can
                            raise problems through the procedures of the Quadrapartite Agreement but
                            that the Western Powers may refuse to talk about these issues. That is
                            not a serious way to look at that agreement. Consent is not necessary to
                            have a discussion under the agreement. One party can ask for
                            consultations. If these are not agreed to, <pb n="4" xml:id="d92-04"
                                facs="d92-04"/>the Soviets could always pay back in kind. The Soviet
                            Union could refuse to consult on matters of interest to the Western
                            Powers. But why should we project a confrontation? I am not saying that
                            we have yet made a decision to raise this issue. It should not be
                            necessary for us to have a confrontation. It is not in the interest of
                            the Western Powers.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Not in our interest to have a confrontation?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName>: Yes.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: We are not interested in having a confrontation but it depends
                            very much on what the issue is. I don't think that you understand fully
                            that we have made a major political gesture and hope that this will
                            solve the problem. The Foreign Minister spoke of a proposal to take this
                            matter up under the Quadrapartite Agreement but he should understand
                            that actions in the Western Sector are only of concern to the Western
                            Powers. This office is only of concern to the Western Powers and we have
                            in effect given ironclad guarantees about the future. I don't know what
                            position we would take if the Soviet Union asked for formal
                            consultations but we don't really think that is necessary. Basically, we
                            do not wish Berlin to become again a center of attention. This is why we
                            have made an effort to solve this problem. We hope that the Soviet side
                            will think over very carefully what we have proposed. We hope for a
                            constructive solution, especially since we believe the offer that has
                            been made is a significant gesture which ought to take care of the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName>: Let us put things in
                            their proper place. We take note of your position on the future
                            situation but the main issue is linked with an explanation of what
                            happens in the past. The situation would be different if the decision
                            could be suspended de facto. The West Berliners would know that matter
                            has been referred to the three Powers and that we are thinking of
                            raising it under the <pb n="5" xml:id="d92-05" facs="d92-05"
                            />Quadrapartite Agreement. The Soviet Union has a direct interest in
                            what happens under the Quadrapartite Agreement. The fact is that the
                            Quadrapartite Agreement is linked through a chain of other special
                            agreements. In particular I should mention the <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss>/<gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> Transport Agreement
                            which is not included but must take account of the Quadrapartite
                            Agreement. Let us, therefore, separate the future from the past. Let me
                            say again that I discern certain positive elements. Strike “certain”.
                            Let me just say positive elements, little elements. So, in short our
                            position remains as set out in the past and today.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Well, the biggest concession you have made today is to leave
                            out the word “certain”.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName>: This is the situation as
                            we see it and I wanted you to know what our position is.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: I have not detected any readiness on the part of the Federal
                            Republic to pull back on the decision which we and they consider to be
                            legal under the Quadrapartite Agreement. We had hoped to take care of
                            the future problem and that that would take care of this whole
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName>: I doubt whether it is
                            permissible to give non-parties to the Agreement the right to interpret
                            it. Therefore, no reference to the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>
                            will sound convincing.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: The proposal which I have made is not based on legal
                            principles but on the political utility of future actions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName>: But that is a slippery
                            basis.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: But in any agreement there can be disputed points. What I am
                            saying is that we will not approve in the future the establishment of
                            Federal offices.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName>: I am afraid it is now
                            time to go to our other meeting.</p>

                        <p>SECRETARY: We can talk more about this in Washington when you come. Is
                            that all right with you?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName>: Don't underestimate the
                            strength of our position in this matter.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: At least you can see that we have made efforts of a “certain
                            kind”.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_GAA1">GROMYKO</persName>: In that latter
                            definition “certain” is closer to reality. Don't be in a hurry.</p>
                        <p>I also want to mention the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Conference.
                            I think it would be desirable to consult about it in advance.</p>
                        <p>SECRETARY: Yes, I think we can do this through diplomatic channels here.
                            I don't really believe anything useful will come out of those
                            meetings.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_VYM1">Vorontsov</persName> called before lunch in
                            response to my phone call to him from San Clemente on July 26 (Tab B) on
                            the Berlin access problem. He said he had a response which said that
                            selective controls were in fact being carried out, as we had been warned
                            they would, but that these were not intended to create obstacles to
                            normal transit. (He subsequently, at my request, sent over the full text
                            of the Soviet response, Tab A).</p>
                        <p>I said that the interference continued to be of concern to us and that it
                            was a disturbing element. He said this should not be so since the intent
                            was to be selective and not to interfere with normal traffic. I said I
                            would have to bring the response to your attention and would be back in
                            touch.</p>

                                <item>-- We had hoped not to get into a formal exchange on this

                        <p>There is now pressure in the Bonn Group to proceed to a formal demarche
                            and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> is asking for a meeting of

                            these developments. If you agree to the points to be made to <persName

                            Soviets. (Genscher et al were of course present when we had the original
                            contact with <persName corresp="#p_VYM1">Vorontsov</persName> in San
                            Clemente and we also informed the British and French. ) If developments
                            warrant, we could join the British and French in a joint formal demarche
                            to Moscow later.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName> noted that he
                            had mixed emotions about assuming his new post, given his age and the
                            fact that he purportedly had retired from public life, but continued to
                            say that he heard, and was responding to, the call of duty. He remarked
                            that until recently he was unsure of his appointment for two reasons:
                            first, negotiations dealing with the establishment of diplomatic
                            relations took much longer than originally anticipated; and, second, it
                            was problematical in his mind, having been nominated by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName>, whether President Ford
                            would sustain the nomination. He felt that he had used the interim
                            period profitably, however, by devoting his time to an extensive study
                            of Germanic history, beginning with the era of the Frank, Charles
                            Martel.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d94-02" facs="d94-02"/>
                        <p>Now, though, he is in the process of receiving a series of serious
                            briefings, which has highlighted for him the delicacy and sensitivity of
                            his forthcoming assignment.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName> acknowledged
                            that he had little on-the-ground experience vis-a-vis Berlin and the
                                <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, noting that he had visited the
                            city as a tourist and had spent a short time in what later became the
                            Soviet zone of occupation and, subsequently, the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> when World War II hostilities ceased in May 1945. He
                            commented that he knows less than he would like to know about the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s government personalities, and
                            wondered, for example, whether <persName corresp="#p_HE2">Erich
                                Honacker</persName> was pursuing the same hard line as that hewed to
                            by Walter Ulbricht. Regardless, he said that he recognizes the degree to
                            which the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>'s policies are shaped in
                            Moscow, and his approach, from the outset, is going to be firm,
                            particularly where access to Berlin and other provisions of the
                            Quadripartite Agreement are concerned. He intends to be especially
                            conscious and observant of <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> attempts
                            to harass our military personnel when in East Berlin and when operating

                            where U.S. interests are involved. SecDef responded that it is difficult
                            to put one's finger on U.S. interests, especially since--given our
                            ambivalent attitude over the years--it is not clear whether we really
                            want to normalize relations with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                            >GDR</gloss>. He noted, however, that Ambassador <persName

                            First, we place great value on our relationship with the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. The <gloss target="#t_FRG1"
                                >FRG</gloss> is the backbone of <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss> in Europe; its contribution to the Alliance is
                            critical. The <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> should be handled in
                            such a way that the developing relationship between it and the U.S. does
                            not result in any reduction in the close comradeship we share with the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Second, it would be most useful
                            if, in his dealings with the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>,
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName> could seek to
                            separate the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> from the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Toward that end, he might allude to
                            the contribution that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> makes to
                            the Warsaw Pact's total military strength; point out that without that
                            contribution the Soviets would be less inclined to entertain an ambition
                            to attempt to overrun Western Europe; and convince the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> that it would be absolutely
                            catastrophic for that nation and its people if an attempt to overrun the
                            West were made. The Soviets, of course, are the only ones who could
                            entertain such ambitions; right now, they are quiescent. Should the
                            situation change, however, the most valuable roles the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> could play would be those of
                            restraining the Soviets and, failing that, of convincing the Soviets to
                            terminate hostilities quickly.</p>

                        <p>SecDef remarked that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> has been a
                            relatively reserved participant in <gloss target="#t_MBFR1"
                            >MBFR</gloss>; its attitude in Vienna has been serious and in keeping
                            with its perceived role as a member in high standing of the Warsaw Pact.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName> said that he
                            was sure that the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss> was following the
                            Soviet line. SecDef continued, emphasizing that we won't permit the
                                <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>'s emasculation in order to
                            satisfy the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and noting that there
                            has been no real progress on <gloss target="#t_MBFR1">MBFR</gloss>. If
                            anything, the tone has become colder and the Soviets are marking time
                            while awaiting SALT results. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_JAA1"
                                >Jordan</persName> added that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> is making a constant effort to drive a wedge between
                            the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. Our position is
                            that Phase I reductions affect only the forces of the U.S. and the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>; the East is pressing for
                            across-the-board reductions in Phase I and has proposed a matched

                            and Poland. It is not happenstance that the East has suggested a

                            between the U.S. and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, the

                                >NATO</gloss> forces and the relative East-West balance. He asked

                            answered that, though he is more comfortable about American attitudes of
                            today, compared to those of the past, he is not comfortable about the
                            disintegration he sees taking place in Europe. Asked whether he includes

                            developments, SecDef emphasized that he did not include the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>. In fact, one of the results of
                            disintegration has been that of drawing the U.S. and the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> even closer together on a bilateral
                            basis. Some of the Allies, for example, Norway and Turkey, continue to
                            be relatively steadfast; others, including Greece, Italy and Portugal,
                            are plagued with problems of political disarray and faltering economies.
                            Those problems, of course, affect military cohesion. In response to

                        <p>President: What was the final tally on Marlow [Cook]?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName>: About 73,000. I really
                            thought he had a chance. He carried Lexington. Our district didn't do
                            well.</p>
                        <p>In relationship to your campaign -- you hurt no one. And I'm not just
                            buttering you up. In fact you helped. Before you came, the Republicans
                            had given up.</p>
                        <p>President: My reaction is the same. Bob Dole said my stop in Wichita made
                            the difference. Also in Utah. My own district is what hurts. We lost by
                            1-2%.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName>: I knew when I was going
                            to win and when I was going to lose. Marlow knew what he was up against.
                            Kentucky is 2-to-1 regular Democrat. There is no feeling against you. It
                            wasn't a referendum on your program. On taxes, you may have to raise
                            them a little.</p>
                        <p>President: We apparently lost four in the Senate and 39-to-40 in the
                            House. When you think what we were carrying -- Watergate, inflation,
                            etcetera.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName>: They all like you. It is
                            not discouraging.</p>
                        <p>President: We can now allege they have co-equal responsibility. They can
                            be held accountable. <pb n="2" xml:id="d95-02" facs="d95-02"/>When do
                            you leave?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName>: Two weeks from Friday. I
                            am your representative. They are tough people and it will be a tough
                            time. There isn't much knowledge about the Communist Party and how it
                            works and what its objectives are. The Soviets are there with 300,000
                            troops and maybe they don't like them. Then there is Berlin.</p>
                        <p>President: Be firm. We didn't send you to capitulate. We won't take
                            anything from them. We are sending a good man and we won't take any
                            guff.</p>
                        <p>After the war, I negotiated with the Soviet Union over displaced persons.
                            We had orders to send them back to the Soviet Union. I was only a
                            Lieutenant but I protested to Patton and they changed the order.</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName>: I will stand firm, don't
                            worry. I know I have your and <persName corresp="#p_KHA1"
                                >Kissinger</persName>'s confidence. I will look at the staff, and if
                            I don't like them, I will make some changes.</p>
                        <p>President: Who is your Deputy?</p>
                        <p>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName>: Grove. I don't know him,
                            but he wanted to open the Embassy before I got there.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Your upcoming visit to Berlin requires careful planning. What you do or
                            say in Berlin could affect not only relations with the <gloss

                            give a public speech in Berlin and if so, on what subject and before

                        <p>THE SETTING</p>
                        <p>Visits by important American officials to Berlin have traditionally been
                            the occasion for forceful demonstrations of our support for the freedom
                            of the city. Such visits have become stylized and Berliners, still
                            confused by the complicated political situation which has emerged from
                            the Quadripartite Agreement, will be sensitive to elimination of any of
                            the traditional elements of a Berlin visit, such as a stop at the Wall.
                            They will analyze your every word for hints of changes in the American
                            posture. Given events of the past year, they will pay special attention
                            to your comments on ties between West Berlin and the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> and to your treatment of the
                            relationship between difficulties in Berlin and progress in other areas
                            of East-West relations.</p>
                        <pb n="2" xml:id="d96-02" facs="d96-02"/>
                        <p>You will be in Berlin during a critical period for the <gloss
                                target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss> domestic political situation. Nerves
                            will still be on edge in the aftermath of the Lorenz kidnapping, and you
                            will arrive in the middle of a series of Landtag elections in which the
                            performance of the coalition parties, and especially Genscher's FDP, is
                            likely to be poor. Genscher has personally adopted the Berlin issue as
                            an example of his firmness in dealings with the East. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SCW2">Schmidt</persName> is therefore obliged to adopt a
                            similar stance. The two will probably wish to be seen with you in public
                            during your stay in Berlin and will expect your support for a firm line
                            on Berlin issues while you are there. Statements or actions which seem
                            to waver from such a line will be used by the CDU/CSU as evidence that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SCW2">Schmidt</persName> and Genscher do not
                            enjoy full <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss> support in Berlin.
                            Conversely, too open public identification with Schmidt and Genscher
                            could lead to opposition charges of mixing in German domestic
                            politics.</p>
                        <p>The issues on which Berliners and West Germans will be expecting a firm
                            position from you are, of course, of major importance to the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss>. Soviet and East German leaders may interpret some of
                            your public efforts to meet Berlin sensitivities as being against the
                            spirit of detente. In light of traditional Soviet sensitivity on the
                            matter of <gloss target="#t_FRG1">FRG</gloss>-West Berlin ties, the East
                            may even object to <persName corresp="#p_SCW2">Schmidt</persName>'s and
                            Genscher's presence in Berlin during your stay. Finally, there may be
                            pressure, both from the East Germans and from Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_CJS1">Cooper</persName>, for a visit to East Berlin.
                            Given continued hostility between the <gloss target="#t_GDR1"
                                >GDR</gloss> and West Berlin and sensitivities in West Berlin about
                            East Berlin's development as a de facto capital of the <gloss
                                target="#t_GDR1">GDR</gloss>, such a visit would negate the positive
                            political and psychological impact of your activities in West Berlin. It
                            would also represent much too high a level of contact with the East
                            Germans at this early stage in our bilateral relations.</p>

                        <p>You cannot satisfy everyone in the visit. The least controversy will
                            result if you restrict your <pb n="3" xml:id="d96-03" facs="d96-03"
                            />activities to the usual round of visits and ceremonial occasions which
                            constitute a normal show of friendship and support for West Berlin and
                            for West German efforts to maintain the viability of the city. This
                            would allow for a modest amount of “drum beating” which could be
                            justified if the Soviets were to complain.</p>
                        <p>A visit along these lines could include: <list>
                                <item>-- a ceremonial visit to the Rathaus and signature of the
                                    Golden Book;</item>
                                <item>-- a stop at a Berlin institution; industrial, cultural or
                                    governmental;</item>
                                <item>-- an act taking cognizance of the division of the city, such
                                    as a visit to the Wall;</item>
                                <item>-- some contact with Allied forces such as a visit to American

                            </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Controversial aspects of the visit can be minimized by choice of
                            institutions to be visited and the manner in which the events are
                            handled. <pb n="4" xml:id="d96-04" facs="d96-04"/>It would probably be
                            unwise to visit the Reichstag or Checkpoint Charlie, for example. And
                            the obligatory visit to the Wall can be made least dramatic by
                            approaching the sectoral boundary at the Brandenburg Gate rather than
                            from one of the more emotion-laden observation points such as
                            Bernauerstrasse or Potsdamer Platz.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">

                        </p>
                        <p>During the visit, you will have to make some public remarks. It will be
                            difficult to limit these to a few words, especially in light of
                            traditional use by American leaders of Berlin as a platform for major
                            speeches. A further argument in favor of a longer and more formal speech
                            is the attention it would focus -- both East and west -- on the
                            continued American commitment to Western Europe, a point useful to
                            underscore in the midst of considerable <gloss target="#t_US1"
                                >US</gloss>-Soviet diplomatic activity.</p>
                        <p>It would probably be wise to avoid the demonstrative public forum used by
                            both Presidents <persName corresp="#p_KRT1">Kennedy</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_NRM1">Nixon</persName> during their visits to
                            the city. A less public forum would be more controllable and less
                            provocative to the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The Berlin House of Representatives would provide a dignified occasion
                            for a speech in a setting which demonstrates West Berlin's dedication to
                            democratic government. Appearing before an official body would allow you
                            to deliver a ceremonial address and would remove pressure for statements
                            of a policy nature. Using the House of Representatives as a forum would
                            also allow you to refuse speaking invitations from private groups, which
                            are now beginning to come in, without offending anyone.</p>

                            get to trade. <persName corresp="#p_HE2">Honecker</persName> says he

                        <p>West Germany has a big embassy.</p>

                            never mention Vietnam or economics, except trade. He said you were the
                            biggest moral influence since Eisenhower. We should make the greatest
                            efforts we can with them. A better trade relationship would help.</p>

                        <p>MEMORANDUM FOR THE ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY
                            AFFAIRS</p>
                        <p>THE WHITE HOUSE</p>
                        <p>Since assumption by the four wartime allies of supreme authority in
                            Berlin, the <gloss target="#t_US1">US</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> and France have maintained sensitive surveillance
                            capabilities in their respective sectors of the city in order to meet
                            their obligations to assure the security and public order of the Western
                            sectors. Such activities consist essentially of [<hi rend="italic">text
                                not declassified</hi>]In the American sector, these responsibilities
                            are carried out by the Army's Special Operations Field Office (<gloss
                                target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>The Department of the Army has now determined that such activities are no
                            longer an appropriate function for Army personnel. Army and Defense
                            officials have informed us that if another agency cannot be induced to
                            take over these functions, the Army wishes to discontinue them
                            altogether. The future of the Special Operations Field Office has been
                            at issue between State and Army for almost a year, but we have been
                            unable to agree on a basis for discussing continuation of its
                            operations. We now understand that the Department of the Army is
                            planning unilateral action to terminate Field Office activities by the
                            end of this year.</p>
                        <p>As with most aspects of the Berlin occupation, this activity is legally
                            authorized under the President's Constitutional authority as Commander
                            in Chief, which has been delegated through a series of Executive Orders.
                            The current one, E.O. 11652, like its predecessors, did not explicitly
                            deal with or regulate surveillance activities. The Department of State
                            agrees that developments of recent years have made necessary a
                            reappraisal of the basis of authority and scope of activities of the
                                <gloss target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss>. We believe <pb n="2"
                                xml:id="d98-02" facs="d98-02"/>that the Department of the Army
                            should be provided a more explicit mandate for this activity than it has
                            had, and should not be expected to retain sole responsibility for the
                            activities of this office. We are ready to discuss means of assuring
                            that its activities do not unfairly burden any single U.S. Government
                            agency, and that they are reserved for clearly justified
                            investigations.</p>
                        <p>However, given the importance of maintaining the capabilities of the SOFO
                            in Berlin, the Department of State cannot agree that these activities
                            can be terminated, especially through unilateral action by one of the
                            agencies involved. If the Special Operations Field Office were to be
                            closed, [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Given the importance of this question to basic legal and political
                            interests of the United States in Berlin, the Department of State
                            requests that the future of the Special Operations Field Office be made
                            a matter of formal National Security Council consideration. Pending
                            inter-agency discussion and decision, the Department of State would be
                            grateful if you could ensure that the Department of the Army takes no
                            unilateral action adversely affecting this operation.</p>

                            on the future of the Special Operations Field Office in Berlin (<gloss
                                target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss>). Mr. Richard V. Kearney, Principal
                            Deputy General Counsel of the Army will be the Defense Department's
                            representative on the study group.</p>
                        <p>(S) As you probably are aware, the issue has been the subject of
                            considerable correspondence and discussion between State and Defense
                            over an extended period of time. Essentially, the Defense position is
                            that the Army should not now be engaged in the types of activities
                            performed by <gloss target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss>. Our reasons are: <list>

                                    Army and other U.S. governmental agencies have been customers to
                                    an insignificant degree (less than 15%).</item>

                                    is largely symbolic and hence is dispensable.</item>

                                        >SOFO</gloss> which are initiated by the Army and are

                                    climate, should be tasked to continue to perform functions which
                                    are clearly outside the ambit of traditional military missions
                                    or responsibilities.</item>

                        <p>(S) I agree the study group should carefully evaluate the values --
                            current and future -- of the activities now being conducted by <gloss

                                >SOFO</gloss>) in Berlin has been conducting [<hi rend="italic">text

                            to insure security and public order in the city. The Departments of

                            the traditional missions of the Army, and hence Army should no longer
                            operate <gloss target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss>. The Department of State
                            believes that important U.S. legal and political interests are involved
                            and, since the interested agencies could not come to an agreement,
                            requested that the future of <gloss target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss> be

                            that <gloss target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss> activities are authorized by

                        <p>-- State and <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> consider that E.O. 11905
                            expressly grants Defense authority to conduct programs such as <gloss

                            national intelligence objectives. Justice essentially agrees that there
                            is sufficient legal authorization for Army to operate <gloss

                        <p>State believes that the statute authorizing functions granted to the
                            Secretary of the Army is broad enough to include any military government
                            function, including expenditure of funds, authorized by the President.

                                >CIA</gloss> Act of 1949, and demonstrations of clear intent by the
                            Executive and Congress that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is to

                            whose charter is circumscribed by law and regulation, and which lacks

                        </p>
                        <p>The continuation of critical SOFO activities is necessary to meet U.S.
                            responsibilities in Berlin, and the procedures and legal authority for
                            those activities should be revised.</p>
                        <p>Army's experience, institutionalized procedures, and established
                            relationships argue strongly for <gloss target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss>
                            remaining under Army auspices. Defense's objections are not persuasive.
                            Army is not in Berlin exclusively for the benefit of Army, but for the
                            security of the city and U.S. interests there. Army's responsibility has
                            been clearly set forth in Executive Orders, and also demonstrated de
                            facto by the daily operation of Army in Berlin for some three decades.
                            Whatever legal qualms Defense has about <gloss target="#t_SOFO1"
                                >SOFO</gloss> could be resolved by a revised, more specific
                            Presidential directive.</p>
                        <p>Operating <gloss target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss> under <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> auspices is not attractive for two
                            reasons:</p>
                        <p>-- Justice's determination that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> could
                            not perform certain essential <gloss target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss>
                            activities, except in violation of the law. Defense's proposal to split
                                <gloss target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss> to accommodate Justice's
                            objection seems a step backward in terms of close control and
                            responsiveness to policy considerations.</p>
                        <p>-- [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] is a delicate political
                            matter and enlarging <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>'s role would
                            leave it vulnerable to objections from Congress.</p>
                        <pb n="5" xml:id="d101-05" facs="d101-05"/>
                        <p>In light of these considerations, I propose a Presidential directive in
                            the form of a National Security Decision Memorandum which incorporates
                            the following provisions:</p>
                        <p>-- Army is to continue [<hi rend="italic">text not declassified</hi>] to
                            meet specific security requirements in Berlin.</p>
                        <p>-- Army is to determine the legal adequacy of intercept requests and,
                            together with State, develop and maintain a regulatory regime.</p>
                        <p>-- The Chief of the U.S. Mission is to assure that <gloss

                            responsibilities and interests. He may authorize, in unusually urgent
                            situations, a specific intercept for a limited period, normally no
                            longer than 48 hours.</p>
                        <p>-- <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> is to advise Army on foreign
                            intelligence and counterintelligence intercepts.</p>
                        <p>-- The Attorney General must approve all requests for non-consensual
                            surveillance of U.S. persons, and must be informed of all operations
                            which, though not otherwise requiring his approval, regularly intercept
                            communications of U.S. persons.</p>
                        <p>-- Requests for non-consensual surveillance of any person or organization
                            must be approved at least at the level of Assistant Secretary of the

                        <p>Dear General <persName corresp="#p_SB3">Scowcroft</persName>:</p>
                        <p>This is in reference to the Attorney General's letter of January 7, 1977
                            to you recommending revision of National Security Council Memorandum
                            335, (<gloss target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> 335), and to his proposal
                            that the President sign an order approving interim procedures which he
                            enclosed.</p>
                        <p>The proposal that the President personally sign an order expressly
                            approving the operations of the Special Operation Field Office (<gloss
                                target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss>) is a matter which is for the
                            Attorney General and your office to consider. However, I recommend that
                            the Attorney General withdraw his letter of January 7, 1977 until such
                            time as agreement is reached on the interim procedures. The procedures
                            proposed in the January 7 letter do not conform to our understanding of
                            the state of the law, and if adopted would seriously erode the
                            capability of <gloss target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss> to meets its foreign
                            intelligence and counterintelligence requirements.</p>
                        <p>The statement in the January 7 letter to the effect that <gloss
                                target="#t_NSDM1">NSDM</gloss> 335 is an excessively broad
                            authorization, and that “no activity under <gloss target="#t_NSDM1"
                                >NSDM</gloss> 335 should be conducted until the President signs an
                            order expressly approving the operation” causes me considerable concern.
                            This tends to place a legal cloud on on-going <gloss target="#t_SOFO1"
                                >SOFO</gloss> operations which I do not believe is warranted. These
                            operations have been recently reapproved by the President, and it is my
                            belief had the personal approval of the Attorney General last August. I
                            am unaware of any legal developments since that time which now make
                            illegal what was considered legal last August. Consequently, if <gloss
                                target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss> operations are not to be suspended
                            immediately, the Attorney General's letter should not remain before the
                            President.</p>

                        <p>From an operational standpoint, adoption of the proposed procedures would
                            lead to a drastic reduction in <gloss target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss>'s
                            foreign intelligence activities. [<hi rend="italic">text not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Although less critical to <gloss target="#t_SOFO1">SOFO</gloss>
                            operations, a corresponding change should be made [<hi rend="italic"
                                >text not declassified</hi>] A limited number of other changes have
                            also been proposed to me, but which are not sufficiently substantive to
                            require elaboration at this time.</p>
                        <p>The final area of concern relates to the scope of the Attorney General's
                            authority to regulate foreign intelligence activities. The proposed
                            interim procedures are identified as flowing from the authority
                            conferred on him by Executive Order 11905. However, that Order gives him
                            regulatory authority only under specifically defined conditions. For
                            example, regulations governing electronic surveillance operations are
                                <pb n="3" xml:id="d104-03" facs="d104-03"/>subject to his approval
                            if (1) the person targeted, wherever located, is a United States person
                            or (2) the sender or receiver of the communication is in the United
                            States. The Order does not provide that intelligence operations
                            conducted solely outside the United States (in this instance the U.S.
                            Military Occupation Zone in Berlin), and against non-United States
                            persons, are subject to his regulatory powers. Similarly, the Order
                            provides that the interception of mail in “United States postal
                            channels” is prohibited except in accordance with laws and regulations.
                            But it most certainly does not purport to regulate foreign postal
                            systems when the mail concerned does not involve United States persons.
                            For reasons that are not clear, the interim procedures impose
                            restrictions on intelligence and counterintelligence operations against
                            persons who are not entitled to Fourth Amendment protection, and who are
                            not within the contemplation of the Executive Order.</p>
                        <p>In light of the sensitivity of these issues, and the need for an early
                            resolution of them by this Administration, I recommend that you consult
                            with the Attorney General and other members of the Intelligence
                            Community at the earliest possible date.</p>
